# Closes Docker-published "internal" ports (postgres, doltgres, redis,
# litellm, OpenFGA, temporal-grpc) to the public internet on Cogni Cherry VMs.
#
# Why DOCKER-USER and not UFW: Docker publishes ports via DNAT in
# nat/PREROUTING and forwards via the DOCKER chain, bypassing UFW's INPUT.
# DOCKER-USER runs before Docker's own forward rules, so a DROP here is the
# canonical hook (per Docker docs).
#
# Why we still allow 10.42/16 + 10.43/16: k3s pods reach host services via
# the VM's public IP (Cherry has no private NIC; EndpointSlice points at
# the public IP). The kernel routes pod->public-IP traffic locally, so the
# pod's source IP is preserved into DOCKER-USER. Allow flannel pod CIDR +
# k3s service CIDR.
#
# Idempotent: tagged rules are removed before re-insertion.
# Links: bug.5167

# This script is the sole DOCKER-USER writer, but it is reached by several

# Decentralized-compute egress allowlist (task.5044): node-app workloads running on
# external compute (e.g. Akash providers) dial the shared substrate on these same
# internal ports. One entry per line in $ALLOWLIST_FILE: `CIDR` or `CIDR:port,port`
# (comments/# allowed); each gets an ACCEPT ahead of the public DROP, scoped to the
# named ports (default: all internal ports). Empty/absent file = no external compute.
# Provider egress IPs are multi-tenant — grant only the ports the workload dials.
#
# task.5052 — the allowlist is CATALOG-RENDERED (CATALOG_IS_SSOT), not hand-managed:
# deploy-infra.sh renders infra/catalog/*.yaml `compute_egress_cidrs` via
# scripts/ci/render-compute-egress-allowlist.sh and stages the result at
# $STAGED_ALLOWLIST on every deploy. Installing it here — even when it contains no
# allow lines — is what makes catalog REMOVAL converge on the next run. No staged
# file (cloud-init boot runs before any deploy; a fresh VM has no installed file
# either) = fail-closed until the first deploy stages one. Paths are overridable
# for tests only.
