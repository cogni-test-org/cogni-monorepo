## Metadata

- **Owners:** @derekg1729
- **Status:** draft

## Purpose

Everything about how the system runs. Split by responsibility, not by tool.

## Pointers

- [CD Pipeline E2E](../docs/spec/cd-pipeline-e2e.md): Full deployment specification
- [catalog/](catalog/): Renderer-agnostic app/node inventory
- [k8s/](k8s/): Kubernetes deployment manifests (Argo CD + Kustomize)
- [compose/](compose/): Docker Compose stacks (VM-shared infra runtime)
- [grafana/](grafana/): Grafana Cloud dashboards and alerting resources as code
- [images/](images/): Infra-owned Docker image build contexts
- [provision/](provision/): Substrate/bootstrap (OpenTofu, cloud-init)
- [akash/](akash/): Akash pointer README — the SDL renderer SHIPPED as TypeScript (`nodes/operator/app/src/adapters/server/compute/akash-sdl.ts`, task.5044); node apps target Akash per ci-cd.md Axiom 23
- [crossplane/](crossplane/): Pinned OSS reconciliation substrate installed through Argo; lifecycle APIs/compositions live here as they replace the bespoke compute controller (story.5016 R2)

## Boundaries

```json
{
  "layer": "infra",
  "may_import": [],
  "must_not_import": ["*"]
}
```

## Public Surface

- **Exports:** Kustomize overlays (k8s/), Crossplane packages/compositions (crossplane/), Docker Compose stacks (compose/), Terraform modules (provision/)
- **CLI:** `kubectl kustomize infra/k8s/overlays/{env}/{app}/`, `tofu plan` in `infra/provision/cherry/base/`

## Responsibilities

- This directory **does**: Define deployment manifests, infrastructure config, image builds, app catalog
- This directory **does not**: Contain application code, business logic, or test suites

## Directory Responsibilities

| Directory     | Answers                                                            | Changes when...                                   |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `catalog/`    | What apps/nodes exist?                                             | A new node is added                               |
| `k8s/`        | How do apps deploy to Kubernetes?                                  | Image digests or manifests change                 |
| `grafana/`    | What Grafana dashboards/alerts exist?                              | Observability UI or alerting changes              |
| `compose/`    | What infra services run on the VM?                                 | Infrastructure config changes                     |
| `images/`     | How are infra-owned images built?                                  | LiteLLM/proxy code changes                        |
| `provision/`  | How is the VM created and bootstrapped?                            | Cloud provider or bootstrap changes               |
| `akash/`      | How do apps deploy to Akash?                                       | (Future — SDL renderer)                           |
| `crossplane/` | Which OSS reconciliation packages and workload APIs are installed? | Crossplane packages, XRDs, or Compositions change |

## Standards

- `catalog/` is the SSoT for nodes (`CATALOG_IS_SSOT`, ci-cd.md axiom 16). Each `catalog/<name>.yaml` declares: `name`, `type` (node/service), `port`, `node_id` (uuid; node only), `dockerfile`, `image_tag_suffix`, `migrator_tag_suffix`, `path_prefix` (consumed by `scripts/ci/detect-affected.sh`), and `{candidate_a,preview,production}_branch`. Schema is `catalog/_schema.json` (validated on every PR by `check-jsonschema`). Do not add runtime container config, image digests, or non-GitOps wiring here.
- `k8s/` and `akash/` are peer renderers. Both read from `catalog/`.
- `crossplane/` owns OSS reconciliation machinery, not provider credentials or environment-specific desired-state instances.
- `compose/` is for infra services intentionally kept off-cluster.
- `images/` contains only Dockerfiles and build contexts, not runtime config.
- `provision/` owns VM lifecycle. Runtime manifests go in renderers.

## Change Protocol

- Update this file when **top-level directory structure changes**
- Adding a new renderer: create `infra/{renderer}/` as peer to `k8s/`

## Notes

- `infra/cd/` was renamed to `infra/k8s/` and `infra/tofu/` to `infra/provision/` in the CD pipeline implementation
- `infra/litellm/` moved to `infra/images/litellm/`, `infra/compose/sandbox-proxy/` to `infra/images/sandbox-proxy/`
- See `docs/spec/cd-pipeline-e2e.md` §0 for the rationale behind the directory layout
