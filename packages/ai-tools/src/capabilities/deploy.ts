/**
 * Module: `@cogni/ai-tools/capabilities/deploy`
 * Purpose: Deploy capability interface for AI tools — typed read over the node-network's per-(env,node) deploy state, the seam the deploy brain migrates into off `.sh`/workflow_dispatch.
 * Scope: Defines the read-only v0 DeployCapability (sibling of VcsCapability). Does NOT implement transport, mutate deploy state, or provision compute (that is ComputeResourcePort).
 * Invariants:
 *   - CAPABILITY_INJECTION: Implementation injected at bootstrap, not imported.
 *   - ADAPTER_SWAPPABLE: Argo/k8s adapter for v0; the interface never names a provider.
 *   - ARGO_IS_TRUTH: Reads live Argo/catalog state; it is NOT a parallel control plane. Promotion
 *     reuses the existing VcsCapability.dispatchCandidateFlight seam; Argo stays the reconciler and
 *     git stays the deploy-state truth (ci-cd.md Axioms 4 & 6).
 *   - PROVIDER_AGNOSTIC: Speaks the Argo/k8s API, so it is blind to the compute substrate underneath
 *     (Cherry today, Akash future). Compute provisioning + crypto settlement live in a separate
 *     ComputeResourcePort, never here.
 * Side-effects: none (interface only)
 * Links: docs/spec/cicd-platform-boundary.md § "The next layer: a typed operator control plane",
 *   docs/spec/mcp-control-plane.md (registry/adapter-swap pattern), PR #628 (Argo GitOps foundation)
