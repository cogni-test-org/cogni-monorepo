/**
 * Module: `@cogni/ai-tools/capabilities/vcs`
 * Purpose: VCS capability interface for AI tools — GitHub API operations (PR management, branches, CI status).
 * Scope: Defines VcsCapability for remote VCS operations. Does NOT implement transport.
 * Invariants:
 *   - CAPABILITY_INJECTION: Implementation injected at bootstrap, not imported
 *   - VCS_WRITE_CAPABLE: Supports both read and write operations (merge, branch creation)
 *   - ADAPTER_SWAPPABLE: Interface supports Octokit (v0) or gh CLI (future sandbox agents)
 * Side-effects: none (interface only)
 * Links: task.0242, task.0297, docs/guides/github-app-webhook-setup.md
