/**
 * Module: `@cogni/repo-spec/deployment-activation`
 * Purpose: Pure splice of the stock `cogni-node-app-v1` `deployment:` block into an existing spec.
 *   Existing nodes predate the deployment contract and ride the legacy secret-free default, which
 *   external-compute placement refuses (`assertDeclaredNodeDeployment`); the operator mints this
 *   block back into the node's OWN repo — never hand-edited YAML.
 * Scope: Pure string transform over the current `.cogni/repo-spec.yaml` text; does not perform IO,
 *   read env, or YAML-round-trip the existing content (a string append, so the spec's comments +
 *   ordering are preserved byte-exact). The route layer reads the current file via the App and
 *   persists the result via a PR.
 * Invariants:
 *   - SCAFFOLD_AND_GATE_SHARE_ONE_VALUE: the appended block is `renderNodeDeploymentYaml()` — the
 *     SAME constant the node scaffold emits and the external-compute gate requires, so they cannot
 *     drift.
 *   - NEVER_OVERWRITE_A_DECLARATION: a spec that already carries ANY top-level `deployment:` block
 *     (a node's own hand-authored declaration included) splices to itself.
 *   - IDEMPOTENT_SPLICE: re-splicing an already-spliced spec is a byte-exact no-op.
 * Side-effects: none
 * Links: packages/repo-spec/src/node-app-deployment.ts, packages/repo-spec/src/accessors.ts
 *   (hasDeclaredNodeDeployment), task.5083, story.5016
