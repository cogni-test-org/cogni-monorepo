/**
 * Module: `@cogni/repo-spec/node-app-deployment`
 * Purpose: Holds the one source of truth for the `cogni-node-app-v1` deployment declaration.
 *   It is the block a node carries in its own `.cogni/repo-spec.yaml` — what the node scaffold
 *   emits, what the off-cluster-compute gates require, and what a failure message tells you to add.
 * Scope: Pure data plus YAML rendering over the repo-spec schema; does not perform I/O, select a
 *   provider, resolve secret values, or name any node.
 * Invariants:
 *   - PROFILE_OWNS_ITS_SECRET_CONTRACT: `cogni-node-app-v1` is a named runtime profile declared in
 *     the repo-spec, so the logical secret keys that profile needs to boot are declared beside it.
 *     Scoped by capability (the profile), never by node name.
 *   - SCAFFOLD_AND_GATE_SHARE_ONE_VALUE: the generator that mints a node and the gate that rejects
 *     an incomplete node read the same constant, so they cannot drift.
 *   - RENDER_ROUND_TRIPS: `renderNodeDeploymentYaml` output re-parses to the same declaration.
 * Side-effects: none
 * Links: packages/repo-spec/src/schema.ts, task.5079, story.5016
 * @public

/**
 * Logical secret keys the `cogni-node-app-v1` runtime profile requires to boot.
 *
 * This is a CAPABILITY contract, not a node list: any service that opts into the profile owes
 * these refs, and no node is named. The values themselves live only in the node's own
 * `cogni/<env>/<node>/*` scope and are resolved at the provider-I/O boundary.
 *
 * The profile also implies the fork-image migration layout — `/app/app/migrate.mjs` +
 * `/app/app/migrations` (plus `migrate-doltgres.mjs` when `DOLTGRES_URL` is declared) — which
 * the operator's off-cluster-compute migration gate runs before any placement (bug.5116).
