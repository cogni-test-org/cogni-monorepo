/**
 * Module: `@cogni/temporal-workflows/workflows/node-task.schema`
 * Purpose: Zod schema for `NodeTaskInput` — the single source of truth for the generic NodeTaskWorkflow's input shape.
 * Scope: Schema definition + `z.infer<>` type export + the route/scope helpers that derive from it. Does not contain business logic, runtime I/O, or side-effects.
 * Invariants:
 *   - SINGLE_INPUT_CONTRACT: schema is the single source of truth (see Purpose); `.strict()` rejects typo'd / foreign fields.
 *   - DISPATCH_FAIL_FAST: producers (syncNodeSchedules / schedule-control) parse with this schema before `workflowClient.start(...)`.
 *   - ROUTE_RELATIVE_ONLY (M3/SSRF): `route` is a node-relative path (must start with "/", no scheme/host) — the dispatch activity binds it to the node's OWN resolved host. Absolute/foreign URLs reject at parse time.
 *   - SCOPE_IS_NODE_BOUND (M1+M2): grant scope for a node task is `task:dispatch:<nodeId>:<route>` — the nodeId is embedded so grant↔node binding is structural (the grants table has no node_id column; no migration). The scope is minted + checked in `@cogni/scheduler-core` `scopes.ts` (single source); validation rejects a grant whose embedded nodeId ≠ the dispatched nodeId.
 * Side-effects: none
 * Links: docs/design/node-temporal-tenant-interface.md (story.5008, task.5029), docs/spec/temporal-patterns.md (SINGLE_INPUT_CONTRACT), pr-review.schema.ts (reference)

 * parse time (ROUTE_RELATIVE_ONLY) is the M3 security close.
