title: Knowledge Syntropy — Karpathy-loop umbrella for the node knowledge plane
state: Active
priority: 1
estimate: 13
summary: Umbrella project covering the full compile → Q&A → file-back → lint loop on the node knowledge plane. Spans the write side (gates, EDO crawl, federation), the read side (chain visibility, librarian filtering), and the curator side (auto-summaries, staleness sweeps). Subsumes the previously separate proj.knowledge-write-pipeline (W tiers) and proj.edo-foundation (W1) projects — those were sub-tiers, not independent projects.
outcome: An agent files a hypothesis, takes a decision citing it, the resolver files the outcome on schedule, the chain is browsable on `/knowledge?mode=chains`, the librarian default-filters EDO machinery out of unrelated searches, the curator keeps the index clean, and every editorial write earns its place via the contribution branch. The Karpathy loop runs end-to-end on Doltgres without an agent in the seat.

# Knowledge Syntropy

> Karpathy's loop: `raw → LLM compile → wiki → LLM Q&A → outputs → file back → wiki → LLM lint → wiki`.
> Our job is to make that loop run on Doltgres-backed node knowledge, with provenance, citation DAGs, and per-node sovereignty bolted on.

## Goal

Stand up the full Karpathy compile / Q&A / file-back / lint cycle on the node knowledge plane. Editorial knowledge claims earn their place through gates and a contribution branch; operational state takes a fast path. Predictions are falsifiable, outcomes file themselves, chains are browsable, search defaults stay clean, and a curator keeps the index honest.

This project is the umbrella. It replaces two earlier projects that were really sub-tiers of the same loop:

- **proj.knowledge-write-pipeline** → folded in as the **W0 Gates** tier (shipped via PR #1356).
- **proj.edo-foundation** → folded in as the **W1 EDO Crawl** tier (shipping via PR #1327).

A reviewer reading this page should see one roadmap with one tier ordering and never wonder why those two existed as separate projects.

## Non-Goals

- **No knowledge environments.** Each node has one Dolt hub, one trunk. The code CI/CD `candidate → preview → production` ladder does NOT translate to knowledge.
- **No parallel rules engine.** v1+ AI gates reuse `.cogni/rules/*.yaml` + the `pr-review` graph runner with a `knowledge-evaluations` workflow variant.
- **No cross-node EDO compounding in v1.** Per-node sovereignty bounds chains until Dolt remotes (KNOWLEDGE charter) close that gap.
- **No new tables for the EDO loop.** The four beats are `entry_type` values on `knowledge`; recursion is emergent from `citations`.
- **No materialized confidence triggers.** Doltgres 0.56 has no PL/pgSQL — recompute runs in the adapter.

## The Karpathy Loop on Cogni

```
raw signals / agent output / external sources
        │
        │  W tiers — "LLM compile"
        ▼
contribution branch → gates → main on the node's Dolt hub
        │
        │  R tiers — "LLM Q&A"
        ▼
librarian search + chain UI → agent / human reads
        │
        │  F tier — "file back"
        ▼
agent's outputs re-enter as new knowledge entries with citations
        │
        │  L tiers — "LLM lint"
        ▼
curator: stale sweeps, dedup, promotion, auto-summaries
```

W → R → F → L. Each tier closes one gap before the next is filed.

## Roadmap

> **Agent-facing entry point:** the [`edo-loop`](../../.claude/skills/edo-loop/SKILL.md) skill is the recipe agents follow when filing a chain on this surface.

## Five Write Paths to Operator-Doltgres Knowledge

Knowledge writes are not uniform. There are five paths today, each with a different trust model. The split-brain finding from PR #1327 validation is that path 3 currently violates the editorial-vs-operational split — W2 closes it.

| #   | Path                                                                | Surface           | Trust source             | Lands on                                                           | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

**Frame:** editorial knowledge claims → contribution branch (paths 1, 3-after-W2). Operational state and reference data → direct (paths 2, 4, 5). W2 is specifically about moving path 3 from the wrong column to the right column for bearer principals.

Gates implement a uniform `KnowledgeGate` interface with a chain runner. Per-node sovereignty: future per-node gate sets live in `nodes/<node>/.cogni/knowledge-rules/*.yaml`, picked up by the same chain (W0 v1).

| Rule                             | Constraint                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| GATES_FAIL_CLOSED                | A gate returns `{ ok: false }` → write rejected at API/tool boundary. No soft-warn bypass.                                                                                                           |
| TRUNK_BASED_PER_NODE             | Each node has one Dolt hub, one trunk. No knowledge environments.                                                                                                                                    |
| EDITORIAL_VIA_CONTRIB            | External bearer principals writing editorial knowledge (knowledge/contributions, EDO post-W2) land on a `contrib/<id>` branch first. Operational state and trusted internal callers skip the branch. |
| CONFIDENCE_OUTSIDE_GATES         | Confidence is a row attribute that evolves via citations + outcomes. Gates do NOT promote across confidence tiers.                                                                                   |
| GATES_REUSE_AI_RULES_INFRA       | v1+ AI gates reuse `.cogni/rules/*.yaml` schema and the graph runner with `workflow_id: knowledge-evaluations`. No parallel engine.                                                                  |
| PER_NODE_SOVEREIGN_RULES         | Each node's gate set lives in `nodes/<node>/.cogni/knowledge-rules/*`. Forks own their gates.                                                                                                        |
| AI_PATH_RETURNS_FULL_ROW         | AI consumers (`GET /knowledge/...`, `core__knowledge_search/read`) get full row fidelity. Human-view projection is a separate render layer.                                                          |
| HYPOTHESIS_HAS_EVALUATE_AT       | (W1) `entry_type='hypothesis'` rows must have a non-null `evaluate_at`. Adapter enforces; typed error → HTTP 400.                                                                                    |
| RAW_WRITE_REJECTS_TYPES          | (W1) `core__knowledge_write` rejects `entry_type ∈ {hypothesis, decision, outcome}`. EDO types come through `core__edo_*` only.                                                                      |
| RECOMPUTE_IS_PURE_FROM_CITATIONS | (W1) `recomputeConfidence` reads all relevant citations and computes from scratch; never increments. Order-independent; no locks needed.                                                             |
| LIBRARIAN_HIDES_EDO_BY_DEFAULT   | (R1) Default `core__knowledge_search` excludes EDO machinery types unless the caller opts in.                                                                                                        |

## Constraints

- **One tier in flight at a time.** Don't file tier N+1 until N is in flight or shipped. The roadmap order is the priority order — no fan-out into parallel write/read/curator work.
- **No new tables for the EDO loop.** The four beats (event/hypothesis/decision/outcome) are `entry_type` values on `knowledge`; recursion is emergent from `citations`. New tables require an `## Architecture` amendment with stated rationale.
- **No backwards-compat shims.** Refactor in place; deprecate by row status, not by parallel surfaces.
- **No parallel rules engine.** v1+ AI gates reuse `.cogni/rules/*.yaml` + the `pr-review` graph runner with a `knowledge-evaluations` workflow variant — do not stand up a separate evaluator stack.
- **Per-node sovereignty bounds the loop in v1.** No cross-node EDO compounding until Dolt remotes (KNOWLEDGE charter) close that gap. Citations across nodes are deferred.
- **TOKENS_ARE_THE_PALETTE for HTML-shaped chain UI.** Author markup references `var(--token)` / `hsl(var(--*))`, not hardcoded hex. The renderer's shell ships the chrome.

## Dependencies

- [x] `KnowledgeStorePort` + Doltgres adapter (shipped)
- [x] `core__knowledge_write` tool (shipped)
- [x] External contribution API + `KnowledgeContributionPort` (PR #1133 / #1343)
- [x] Domain registry FK enforcement — P0.5 (PR #1312 merged 2026-05-11)
- [x] W0 gates (PR #1356, shipped)
- [ ] W1 EDO Crawl + W2 Federation gate + R0 Chains — PR #1327, task.5040
- [ ] `.cogni/rules` schema + `pr-review` graph factory — for v1+ AI gates (already exists; needs `knowledge-evaluations` variant)

## As-Built Specs

- [knowledge-syntropy.md](../../docs/spec/knowledge-syntropy.md) — schema, citation DAG, confidence lifecycle, EDO loop, critical-path table mirrors the tier roadmap above.
- [knowledge-data-plane.md](../../docs/spec/knowledge-data-plane.md) — Doltgres infrastructure.
- [knowledge-contribution-api.md](../../docs/design/knowledge-contribution-api.md) — external-write path the gates integrate with.
- [knowledge-domain-registry.md](../../docs/spec/knowledge-domain-registry.md) — registry that EDO writes depend on for FK validity.
- [ci-cd.md](../../docs/spec/ci-cd.md) — code CI/CD this pipeline mirrors structurally (lanes, gates fail-closed, per-app sovereignty).

## Design Notes

- Gate chain lives in `packages/knowledge-store/src/domain/gates/` — pure domain layer with no port dependencies in v0. v1 introduces `KnowledgeGatePort` once YAML loading + per-node rule discovery need an injectable seam.
- v0 deliberately ships TypeScript-coded gates rather than YAML-loaded rules to keep the prototype tight. The YAML loader at v1 is mechanical once the architecture is exercised.
- The capability layer (`createKnowledgeCapability` / `createEdoCapability`) is the seam for internal-tool paths; the contribution service is the seam for the external HTTP path. Both run the same gate chain.
- W1 EDO writes are atomic: one capability call writes the entry + the citation edges + the Dolt commit in one transaction-equivalent unit, so a half-written hypothesis cannot escape.
- Per-node sovereignty bounds EDO chains: an outcome on `poly` cannot cite a hypothesis on `operator`. Cross-node compounding waits on Dolt remotes (see KNOWLEDGE charter).
- See [knowledge-syntropy-expert skill](../../.claude/skills/knowledge-syntropy-expert/SKILL.md) — authoritative planner; tier ordering lives there too.
