# reconcile-env-substrate.sh <env> — tofu-free, idempotent reconcile of an
# environment's OpenBao auth/role/SA substrate (the layer BENEATH the per-node
# substrate runner). Extracted verbatim from provision-env-vm.sh Phase 5b.3-5b.5
# so it is callable WITHOUT a full tofu provision — closing the drift where prod
# (missing db-provisioner) and preview (missing both writer + db-provisioner)
# diverged because Phase 5b only ran inside cold-start provisioning.
#
# Every operation is an upsert / create-if-absent — running it against a live env
# ADDS what's missing non-destructively and a re-run is a no-op. It NEVER inits,
# unseals, or touches data; it only reconciles:
#   - KV v2 mount cogni/ + kubernetes + github-actions auth methods
#   - eso-reader        policy + role  (ESO controller SA, read-only, all envs)
#   - <env>-writer      policy + role  (openbao-writer SA, per-env RW; jwt twin)
#   - <env>-db-reader   policy + role  (db-provisioner SA, per-env read-only)
#   - ClusterSecretStore openbao-backend
#   - argocd-cm         additive merge patch (Argo's `part-of` informer label +
#                       kustomize --enable-helm + ComputeWorkload health rule)
#
# RENAME (additive, safe): the writer SA is `openbao-writer` (was `openbao-operator`).
# The <env>-writer role binds BOTH names during transition, so consumers still on
# the old name keep working until every env is reconciled; the consumer flip
# (secret-materialize.sh → openbao-writer) + dropping openbao-operator is the gated
# follow-up. Both SAs are created here so either token mints.
#
# Auth: needs the env's OpenBao root token (policy/role writes are root-gated).
# Provide via OPENBAO_ROOT_TOKEN, or OPENBAO_ROOT_TOKEN_LOCAL (a file path). The
# token is passed transiently to the pod via env, never persisted (Invariant 13).

# ── argocd-cm merge patch (day-two repair for bug.5095) ─────────────────────
# FIRST, before any OpenBao work: this is what un-wedges a broken Argo. PR #2108
# pointed an Argo Application at a Git manifest declaring `argocd-cm`; server-side
# apply took ownership and replaced `metadata.labels` with Argo's tracking label,
# dropping `app.kubernetes.io/part-of: argocd`. Argo watches its own ConfigMaps
# through an informer with that label as its selector, so the object went invisible
# to every controller — `configmap "argocd-cm" not found` for an object that plainly
# exists — and every Application in the cluster fell to SYNC=Unknown HEALTH=Unknown.
#
# The merge patch restores the identity labels, removes Argo's tracking label, and
# re-asserts the two data keys, all without touching anything else in the object.
# Identical call to provision-env-vm.sh Phase 5b.1 via the shared helper, so cold
# start and day two can never drift. Idempotent — a re-run is a no-op.
