# Module: scripts/ci/run-shell-tests.sh
# Purpose: Run the hermetic scripts/ci/tests/*.test.sh suite in PARALLEL with
#          correct exit-code aggregation, replacing the ~22 serial `bash …` steps
#          that made the `unit` CI job an 8-minute monolith (task.5140). Every
#          listed test is pure-bash — mktemp + PATH-shim sandboxes, or a read-only
#          `cd REPO_ROOT` drift compare against committed files — with no network,
#          docker, or shared writable state, so they are mutually independent and
#          safe to run concurrently with each other.
# Usage:   bash scripts/ci/run-shell-tests.sh
# Exit:    0 iff EVERY test passed; 1 if any failed (a non-zero from any leg is
#          preserved — a green here means all legs were actually green).
#
# SSOT: these arrays are the authoritative wiring for the shell-test suite (it
# used to be inline in .github/workflows/ci.yaml). Gating CI on a new
# scripts/ci/tests/*.test.sh means adding it HERE, not a new workflow step
# (SCRIPTS_ARE_THE_API / CI freeze). This is an EXPLICIT list, not a glob: the
# tests/ dir also holds helpers that are `source`d by other tests
# (openbao-login-retry) and orphaned twins that must never run standalone.
#
# CONCURRENCY MODEL — two tiers, because these tests are NOT uniformly hermetic:
#   MUTATORS  — `cd $REPO_ROOT` and DESTRUCTIVELY touch tracked files (write /
#               hand-stale / `git checkout` real infra/**). Two mutators, or a
#               mutator running alongside a real-tree READER, race on the shared
#               working tree and false-fail (an in-flight staled file is observed
#               by a concurrent --check). Run these SERIALLY, first, ALONE.
#   PARALLEL  — read-only real-tree drift compares + fully mktemp-sandboxed tests.
#               Safe concurrently with EACH OTHER (reads don't mutate); only a
#               concurrent MUTATOR breaks them, which the serial-first phase
#               prevents. Verified: each passes in isolation; the only observed
#               flake was a reader racing the one mutator (render-node-overlays).
# A NEW test that writes/git-restores tracked files under $REPO_ROOT belongs in
# MUTATORS, not PARALLEL.
