# render-scope-filters.sh — emit the `single-node-scope` dorny/paths-filter
# block from the `nodes/*` directory listing (CATALOG_IS_SSOT, axiom 16).
#
# The single-node-scope gate used to hand-list one `<slug>:` filter + one
# `!nodes/<slug>/**` operator negation per node, with single-node-scope-meta.spec.ts
# as a tripwire that failed if you forgot. Adding a node was a manual 2-spot edit.
# This generator loops the on-disk `nodes/*` listing (minus operator) instead, so
# a node birth (a new `nodes/<slug>/` dir) yields its filter + negation for free.
#
# `dorny/paths-filter` needs the filter inline in the workflow, so this script
# generate-and-commits the region of `.github/workflows/ci.yaml` between the
# `# >>> GENERATED scope-filters` / `# <<< GENERATED scope-filters` sentinels.
# `nodes/*` (not catalog type:node) is the SSOT because the gate keys on the
# directory layout the parity tests read; classify.ts + single-node-scope-meta.spec.ts
# agree with this same listing.
#
# Usage: render-scope-filters.sh            # write the filter block to stdout
#        render-scope-filters.sh --write    # splice the block into ci.yaml in place
#        render-scope-filters.sh --check    # fail if ci.yaml's block is stale
