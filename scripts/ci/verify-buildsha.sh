# verify-buildsha.sh — authoritative end-of-deploy gate: assert each node-app
# endpoint serves the SHA the flight claimed to deploy. Catches "green run,
# stale pods" — the pattern where an upstream step silently produced no new
# images (affected-only CI, build failure, wrong overlay), overlays stayed
# unchanged, Argo did nothing, all downstream gates reported green against
# the old pods.
#
# Two modes:
#   1. Single-SHA (preview, candidate): all promoted nodes built from the
#      same PR head SHA. Caller passes EXPECTED_BUILDSHA + NODES.
#   2. Per-app map (production, candidate-a cross-PR): different nodes built from
#      different PR head SHAs (affected-only CI rebuilt a subset; production
#      copies preview's mixed overlay state). Caller passes SOURCE_SHA_MAP
#      pointing to .promote-state/source-sha-by-app.json — the script asserts
#      /version.buildSha against map entries. Optional NODES (CSV): when set,
#      verify only that subset (task.0349; flights pass promoted_apps). When
#      unset, every Ingress-probeable key in the map is checked.
#
# Contract (both modes): `/version.buildSha` equals the expected SHA for this
# node. Any mismatch is a hard failure regardless of prior workflow status.
#
# Endpoint choice (task.0345 / PR #978): we probe the dedicated `/version`
# endpoint rather than `/readyz`. Rationale:
#   - `/version` is unauthenticated and dependency-free (no env, secrets, RPC,
#     or Temporal checks) — it cannot false-fail due to transient infra
#     degradation while the build artifact is correctly deployed.
#   - `/readyz` returns 503 on infra-degraded (by design); serving the right
#     buildSha is a distinct signal from "I am ready to serve traffic".
#   - Separation lets us retire the prior `/readyz.version` field without
#     breaking liveness/readiness semantics.
# Response shape: `{"version": "<pkg-ver>", "buildSha": "<git-sha>", "buildTime": "..."}`
# — we read `.buildSha` (the git SHA); `.version` on this endpoint is the
# package version, NOT a fallback.
#
# Env (single-SHA mode):
#   DOMAIN              (required) base domain (operator Ingress host)
#   EXPECTED_BUILDSHA   (required) PR head SHA — full 40-char hex
#   NODES               (required) CSV of node-app names to verify. MUST be
#                       the set that was actually promoted in this run — do
#                       not default to "operator,poly,resy" because affected-
#                       only CI rebuilds a subset and untouched nodes
#                       legitimately serve a different (prior) PR head SHA.
#                       Pass the empty string to skip (no-op promotion case).
#
# Env (map mode — takes precedence when set and non-empty):
#   DOMAIN              (required)
#   SOURCE_SHA_MAP      path to .promote-state/source-sha-by-app.json. Each
#                       key is an app name; each value is the PR head SHA
#                       that built that app's overlay digest. Unset or
#                       missing file → fall back to single-SHA mode.
#   NODES               (optional CSV) when set and non-empty in map mode:
#                       verify **only** these apps' map entries (intersection),
#                       not every key in the file. Required for affected-only
#                       flights/promotes: the map still carries older SHAs for
#                       apps not promoted this run (task.0349).
#
# Hostname convention: operator → https://$DOMAIN, others → https://$node-$DOMAIN.
