# reconcile-edge-caddy.remote.sh — VM-side edge-Caddy reconcile (one place).
#
# Runs ON THE VM. Both deploy-infra.sh (env-wide infra deploy) and
# reconcile-node-substrate.sh (per-node candidate-flight) scp this here and
# invoke it, so the start-if-down / hash-gated force-recreate logic lives once.
#
# Behavior (idempotent):
#   - caddy not running  → `<compose> up -d` (start the whole edge stack).
#   - caddy running       → hash-gate the Caddyfile + edge .env against the
#     stored sha256s in HASH_DIR; recreate caddy ONLY when one changed, then
#     persist the new hash(es). No change → no-op (no per-flight bounce).
#
# `docker compose up -d` (not `caddy reload`) is required for the recreate: a
# new node always adds a new <SLUG>_DOMAIN to the edge .env, and a graceful
# reload resolves {$<SLUG>_DOMAIN} to empty because Caddy's env is frozen at
# container start — silently dropping the new server block + its cert
# (task.5078). --force-recreate guarantees the bounce even when compose's delta
# detector doesn't classify env_file content as a change.
#
# Inputs (env vars):
#   EDGE_COMPOSE_BIN  Full compose invocation as a string, e.g.
#                     "docker compose --project-name cogni-edge -f /opt/.../docker-compose.yml".
#                     Each caller owns its own --env-file/--project-name shape.
#   CADDYFILE         Path to the rendered Caddyfile to hash-gate.
#   EDGE_ENV_FILE     Path to the edge .env to hash-gate.
#   HASH_DIR          Where the sha256 stamps live (default /var/lib/cogni).
