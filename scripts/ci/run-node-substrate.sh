# run-node-substrate.sh <env> <node> — the ONE per-node substrate runner.
#
# Materialize node-owned OpenBao secrets, then reconcile placement-neutral substrate
# for a SINGLE node in a SINGLE env. The reconciler provisions DB roles/databases,
# ExternalSecrets, and shared runtime inventory for every node; it branches only its
# placement-specific work (for example, k3s Caddy/NodePort edge mutation). External
# compute then performs the read-only Akash prerequisite assertion. This is
# the foundation for uniform substrate behavior across the whole node lifecycle:
# candidate-a flight, preview promote, production promote all call this identically
# — there is no "node-formation" special-case. Whoever the deployable set is, each node
# in it gets its substrate run the same way, everywhere.
#
# Ordering is load-bearing: materialize (the sole OpenBao writer) MUST complete
# before reconcile (read-only db-reader) reads the per-node creds it composed —
# reconcile fails loud if they are absent (Invariant 16). A materialize failure
# aborts before reconcile (set -e), so a half-provisioned node never deploys.
#
# Preconditions (caller owns these GitHub-action concerns): ci-src (this repo) +
# app-src checked out, the node submodule initialized when present, and SSH to the
# VM set up (deploy_key on disk, known_hosts seeded).
#
# Env in: VM_HOST, SSH_OPTS, DOMAIN, APP_SOURCE_DIR, and
#   COGNI_CATALOG_ROOT, HEAD_SHA, NODE_SOURCE_SHA, STATUS_URL,
#   SUBSTRATE_RECONCILE_SUMMARY_FILE — passed through to the two scripts unchanged.

# THE TWO QUESTIONS THIS SCRIPT USED TO CONFLATE (bug.5206).
#
#   WHICH SUBSTRATE THE WORKLOAD DIALS -> this env's VM. The XR states it itself
#     (`runtime.substrateHost: cogni-<env>.vm...`), so DB roles, databases and shared
#     inventory are provisioned HERE, for every lane, always.
#   WHICH VAULT HOLDS THE LANE'S SECRETS -> the vault of the cluster that RECONCILES the
#     lane. Every workload env value reaches Akash as a placeholder resolved in the
#     reconciling cluster, so the paying cluster holds every environment's workload secrets
#     (`akash-actuator-wallet-cutover`: "a mechanism fact, not a preference").
#
# For a k3s row the two answers are the same env and nothing below changes. For an akash
# node's non-production lane they differ, and conflating them is what broke the first poly
# mint: the candidate-a flight wrote 32 keys into the CANDIDATE-A vault, asserted the bank
# complete against it, and reported "provider preflight ready" — while the ExternalSecret
# that actually feeds the lease reads the PRODUCTION vault and reported MissingProviderSecret
# for all seven keys. A green gate resting on an unchecked assumption.
#
# Custody flows DOWN-TRUST, one direction only. This script never reaches UP: a candidate-a
# flight does not hold production's vault and must not — that inversion is explicitly
# rejected. It declines the write it cannot legitimately make, and says where the write
# belongs, instead of performing a local one that looks like success.

# and hands back the env itself, which is the RIGHT reading for an un-placed row but the
# WRONG one for a row whose file simply is not here: it would silently restore the exact
# fail-open bug.5206 was. Fail loud instead; every caller already passes COGNI_CATALOG_ROOT.
