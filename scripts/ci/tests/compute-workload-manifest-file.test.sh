# bug.5148 — the deploy lane must RESOLVE the rendered workload manifest's filename from the
# catalog, never hardcode it. ONE_AUTHORITY_PER_WORKLOAD: a `compute_api: crossplane` cell
# renders `xcomputeworkload.yaml` and deliberately does NOT render `compute-workload.yaml`, so a
# hardcoded `compute-workload.yaml` check can never pass for the Crossplane authority. That is
# exactly what refused the first real Crossplane mint (levelup@f1fd69c2) at
# candidate-flight.yml's "Prepared external ComputeWorkload missing" gate.
#
# Proves the shell twin of resolveNodeComputeApi() + computeWorkloadManifestFile()
# (nodes/operator/app/src/features/compute/{node-compute-api,compute-workload-manifest}.ts):
#   1. absent `compute_api` cell        → legacy     → compute-workload.yaml   (LEGACY_IS_DEFAULT)
#   2. explicit `legacy`                → legacy     → compute-workload.yaml
#   3. explicit `crossplane`            → crossplane → xcomputeworkload.yaml
#   4. unknown value                    → loud, non-zero failure (never a silent downgrade to
#                                         legacy — the two authorities mint Akash leases under
#                                         disjoint idempotence keys, so a quiet fallback buys a
#                                         SECOND PAID LEASE)
#   5. per-env independence: one row's crossplane cell does not leak into its other envs
#   6. the COMMITTED catalog resolves as the deploy lane expects today
#
# Fixture cases run against a throwaway catalog copy via COGNI_CATALOG_ROOT; the committed
# infra/catalog/*.yaml is never mutated.
