# Unit tests for the node-overlay renderer + drift gate (bug.5008):
#   1. Committed wizard-born overlays are in sync with the node-template overlay +
#      catalog (the drift gate that makes a stale migrate path fail CI before flight).
#   2. The renderer is byte-exact to the operator mint path (gens/overlay.ts): a
#      node minted from current main reproduces verbatim.
#   3. The node-template template overlay carries the node-at-root image layout
#      (/app/app) and the ESO secret target (<slug>-env-secrets) directly; the
#      renderer only slug/port-renames it (no path/secret rewrite).
#   4. FALSIFYING GATE: a hand-staled overlay (monorepo migrate path) makes --check
#      red. Without this, the gate could be a no-op.
#   5. Fail-closed: a node-template overlay missing the node-at-root migrate command
#      aborts the render instead of emitting a silently-crash-looping overlay.
#   6. Declarative decommission (story.5020 W3): a renderer-owned overlay dir whose
#      catalog row has left turns --check red, and --write prunes it — while the
#      hand-authored (operator/node-template/scheduler-worker) overlays are never
#      touched. Without this, a decommissioned node leaks orphan overlay config.
#
# FIXTURE NODE — these tests need a concrete wizard-born node as the render example,
# but must NOT hard-couple to one specific slug: env-membership (manage-node-envs)
# can move ANY real node in or out of an env, and a hardcoded example (historically
# `poly`) turned every such move CI-red because the example's committed overlay was
# (correctly) deleted. So the example is DISCOVERED at runtime — the first renderer-
# owned node that is a member of all three envs — and the tree carries ≥1 such node.
# Removing any single node no longer breaks these gates.
