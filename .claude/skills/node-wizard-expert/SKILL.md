# Node Wizard Expert

## Primary Pointer

For any live throwaway-node launch, start with
[`node-wizard-scorecard`](../node-wizard-scorecard/SKILL.md). This skill is the
orientation layer; the scorecard is the execution and proof layer.

## First Recall

Before changing node-wizard launch behavior, recall the operator knowledge block:

- `node-launch-handoff` — `https://cognidao.org/knowledge/node-launch-handoff`

That block is the evolving handoff contract for personal AI assistants launching a newly birthed node. Treat it as the operator-owned playbook; refine it when the launch process changes instead of duplicating long runbooks in the wizard UI.

## Ground Truth

- `.claude/skills/node-wizard-scorecard/SKILL.md`
- `docs/spec/node-baas-architecture.md` — node-as-a-service architecture + substrate model (read for the substrate-gaps work)
- `docs/design/node-wizard-secret-setting.md`
- `docs/guides/node-formation-guide.md`
- `docs/spec/node-ci-cd-contract.md`
- `scripts/ci/reconcile-edge-caddy.remote.sh` · `scripts/ci/reconcile-node-substrate.sh` — the substrate lane (edge + per-node DB/secret reconcile)
- `nodes/operator/app/src/features/nodes/launch-pack.ts`
- `nodes/operator/app/src/app/api/v1/nodes/[id]/launch-pack/route.ts`
- `.claude/skills/conductor-worktree-setup/SKILL.md`
- `scripts/conductor-worktree-setup.sh`
- `scripts/ci/sync-node-template-fork-pr.sh`

## Operating Rule

The wizard should mint and publish birth facts, then hand the launch to an AI assistant through the launch pack. Do not add saved wizard states for CI, GHCR, candidate-flight, Argo sync, or `/version` when those can be derived from GitHub, GHCR, the operator flight API, and the deployed candidate URL.

Recent launch-path finding: generated parent birth PRs for throwaway nodes are
not progress by themselves. Progress is a scorecard row moving from blocked to
pass without privileged manual bridge work. A child commit without a child
`sha-<child-sha>` GHCR image is a blocker, not a deployable pin.

**DNS is automatic; edge is automatic-but-fragile (known gap).** A wizard-born node's public host (`<node>-<env>`) has its A-record upserted by `reconcile-node-dns.sh` (catalog-driven) and its edge Caddy route written by the flight's `node-substrate` job (`reconcile-edge-caddy.remote.sh`). DNS is reliable; the **edge is NOT yet reliably hands-off** — see the substrate-gaps table below (a freshly-flighted node can be Argo-Healthy and serve in-cluster yet return external 000 because Caddy's running config didn't pick up the new site). Canon: [`docs/spec/ci-cd.md` Axiom 21 `DNS_IS_RECONCILED_PER_ENV`](../../../docs/spec/ci-cd.md); operational detail in the `dns-ops` skill. A fresh-flight `NXDOMAIN` is usually negative-cache (`dig <host> +short @1.1.1.1`); a fresh-flight **external 000 with DNS resolving + pod Healthy is the edge-reload gap (bug.5031), not DNS**.

## Substrate E2E is NOT yet hands-off — gaps + heal recipes

The first real **production** node launch (beacon, 2026-06-16) proved the **control plane** (formation, flight dispatch, RBAC) works, but the **substrate plane** (DB + edge + secrets + preview lease) has gaps that each needed manual intervention — _nothing self-healed_. Treat these as known failure modes until the linked work lands. Architecture spec: [`docs/spec/node-baas-architecture.md`](../../../docs/spec/node-baas-architecture.md) (§ Cognition Substrate + the substrate lane).

Production heal needs prod read/SSH (owner-gated; "never SSH prod" is the default — a one-off prod data fix needs explicit owner authorization and a captured follow-up bug). **Pareto fix: make the substrate lane idempotent + verify-and-heal (DB + edge + secrets) so none of these need a human** — bug.5033 + PR #1697 are the first two. Note: work-item IDs (`bug.503x`) currently collide with in-code bug refs (e.g. `bug.5031` is also the Grafana datasource-drift class in committed docs) — confirm against the work API before citing.

## Repo Ancestry Rule

Wizard-minted nodes must be named forks of `node-template`, not GitHub template-generated repos. Template generation copies a snapshot without shared git history, so agents cannot fetch `node-template` and merge future template updates. The publish path should call `GitHubRepoWriter.forkFromTemplate`, wait for the forked `main`, commit only the regenerated `.cogni/repo-spec.yaml` identity on top, and pin that identity commit as the operator submodule gitlink.

If a same-named repo already exists, reuse it only when it is a fork of the configured `NODE_TEMPLATE_OWNER/node-template`; otherwise fail closed and repair the repo lineage explicitly.

## Fast Repair

When a minted test-node fork lags behind `cogni-test-org/node-template`, refresh
its existing PR branch with:

```bash
PR_TITLE='ci: sync <slug> node CI' \
  scripts/ci/sync-node-template-fork-pr.sh cogni-test-org/<slug> <branch>
```

This is the repeatable version of the manual `test-cog` repair: fetch the fork
PR branch, merge the current test-org template, auto-resolve the known stale
`ci.yaml` image-name conflict in favor of the template, run the node workflow
invariant, push, and print the PR/check links.
