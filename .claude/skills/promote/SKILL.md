description: Promote a sha to preview or production in cogni-template, OR diagnose why a promotion silently failed. Use this skill whenever the user says "/promote", "promote to preview", "promote to production", "ship to prod", "flight this sha", "deploy this PR to preview", "heal preview", "heal preview-operator", "prod is stuck on the old sha", or asks about preview/prod buildSha not advancing. Encodes the operator-API flight/promote endpoints (promotion runs as the operator, never a personal gh credential), lease semantics, affected-only + admin-merge gotchas (bug.0443), and the Monitor poll-loop you must arm so the dispatch isn't fire-and-forget. Trigger this even when the user only names the symptom ("preview is on stale sha", "production didn't update", "flight-preview hard-failed") — the diagnosis playbook lives here. Do NOT trigger for ordinary code/test/build work; this is exclusively for cd-pipeline operations.

# Promote — preview + production playbook

You are operating the cogni-template release pipeline. The pipeline is multi-layered (per-node deploy branches, per-node Argo apps, per-node verify-deploy matrix legs) and has several silent-success seams that can make a green workflow lie about what's deployed. **Trust `/version.buildSha` from outside the cluster**, not workflow conclusions and not `/readyz` (Service-level — the old pod can answer it during rolling cutover, returning the prior buildSha while CI thinks rollout is done).

## Promotion runs as the operator — call the API, never personal `gh`

`PROMOTION_RUNS_AS_THE_OPERATOR` ([node-ci-cd-contract.md](../../../docs/spec/node-ci-cd-contract.md) § Env-promotion): every dispatch is an operator-GitHub-App action keyed off your registered Bearer token. **Do not `gh workflow run` a promote/flight — that uses a personal credential and is not allowed.** Drive the ladder over HTTP:

| Step                  | Call                                                                 | Authz (action → relation)                                                                      | Result                                                     |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Flight to candidate-a | `POST /api/v1/vcs/flight {nodeRef:{nodeId, sourceSha}}`              | `node.flight` → `can_flight` (`developer`)                                                     | `202` + `candidate-flight.yml` dispatch (candidate-a only) |
| Promote to production | `POST /api/v1/deploy/promote {nodeId, env:"production", sourceSha?}` | `node.promote_production` → `can_promote_production` (`production_promoter`; `admin` inherits) | `200` dispatched; **app-digest only, `skip_infra=true`**   |
| Preview               | automatic on node `main`-merge                                       | ungated                                                                                        | no agent endpoint — see Preview below                      |

Need the production grant? Agent files `POST /api/v1/nodes/{id}/access-requests {role:"production_promoter"}`; the node owner approves once with `POST /api/v1/nodes/{id}/developers {agentUserId, decision:"approve", role}`. Result codes: `403 authz_denied` = no grant; `503 authz_unavailable` = the env's OpenFGA store is unbootstrapped (≠ denial); `502 dispatch_failed` = RBAC passed but that env's operator App isn't installed. Full playbook: operator knowledge hub, `infrastructure` domain, entry `cicd-agent-playbook`.

Endpoints are advertised at `/.well-known/agent.json`. `sourceSha` is **optional** on promote — omit it and the operator resolves the catalog-pinned digest (no manual source-sha picking). The sections below are the **operator-internal mechanics + diagnosis** behind those endpoints; read them when a dispatch silently fails, not to hand-dispatch.

## When to use

- "promote to preview", "promote to production", "/promote", "ship to prod", "flight this sha", "heal preview", "deploy {PR} to preview/prod"
- "preview is still on old sha", "prod didn't update", "flight-preview hard-failed", "buildSha mismatch"

Do NOT use for code review, test fixes, or routine PR work.

## Ground truth — read first when in doubt

- `.github/workflows/flight-preview.yml` — auto preview trigger on `push:main`, manual recovery dispatch
- `.github/workflows/promote-and-deploy.yml` — does the actual promotion + verification (preview AND production)
- `.github/workflows/pr-build.yml` — `pull_request` (immutable `pr-{N}-{X}` tags) + `merge_group` (`mq-{N}-{Y}` tags); only the latter feeds preview
- `scripts/ci/flight-preview.sh` — dispatch the preview flight for the merged SHA (latest-wins; no lease)
- `scripts/ci/resolve-pr-build-images.sh` — single source of truth for "does the mq-{N}-{sha} image set exist for this PR"
- `scripts/ci/verify-buildsha.sh` — single source of truth for "is this image actually serving"; per-node /version probes + non-Ingress markers
- `scripts/ci/aggregate-decide-outcome.sh` — closes the silent-success seam (bug.0443)
- `scripts/ci/aggregate-rollup.sh` — computes `current-sha = merge-base` of per-node deploy-branch tips; merges per-node `source-sha-by-app.json` preserving unaffected entries
- `scripts/ci/lib/image-tags.sh` — `ALL_TARGETS` / `NODE_TARGETS` from `infra/catalog/*.yaml` (axiom 16, CATALOG_IS_SSOT). Source this; never hardcode target lists.
- Per-env deploy branches: `deploy/{candidate-a,preview,production}-{operator,poly,resy,scheduler-worker}` — per-node since task.0376
- `.promote-state/` files on each deploy branch: `current-sha`, `source-sha-by-app.json`

## Hostname rule (per `verify-buildsha.sh`)

- `operator` → `https://${DOMAIN}` (root). For preview that's `https://preview.cognidao.org`.
- Every other node → `https://${node}-${DOMAIN_PREFIX}.${BASE}` when DOMAIN has 2+ dots, else `https://${node}.${DOMAIN}`. Concretely:
  - poly preview → `https://poly-preview.cognidao.org`
  - resy preview → `https://resy-preview.cognidao.org`
  - production swaps `preview` for the prod hostname (typically `https://www.cognidao.org` for operator + `<node>.cognidao.org` for others — confirm via `vars.DOMAIN` in the production environment).
- scheduler-worker / migrators → no Ingress, no /version. Use `kubectl rollout status` or trust the verify-deploy job's marker emission.

## Preview promotion

**Auto path (default + only path):** a PR merged via merge-queue triggers `flight-preview.yml` on `push:main` → the operator promotes the proven digest. No action, no dispatch. Verify by watching (Monitoring section).

If preview is stuck, it is **not** healed by a hand-dispatch — it is healed by another merge-queue merge (see the two gotchas below). There is no agent-facing preview-promote endpoint; preview rides the trust the node already earned at candidate-a.

### Affected-only gotcha (task.0376)

`flight-preview` only retags nodes that `pr-build` actually built (`RESOLVED_TARGETS`). Untouched nodes are skipped. If preview-operator is broken and the merging PR was poly-only, the heal flight retags poly only — preview-operator stays broken. **Fix:** open a follow-up PR that touches the broken node's paths (`nodes/<node>/app/` or its dir-local `AGENTS.md`) and merge via merge-queue. The merge_group rebuild produces the missing `mq-*-{node}` image; the auto-flight on the resulting `push:main` heals.

> **Migrations amplify this into a silent-success trap.** To land a **DB migration** (registry seed, RLS, backfill) on preview/prod you must deploy the operator image from the commit that CARRIES it — the migrate initContainer only runs migrations baked into the deployed image. Flighting **main head** to heal fails silently when main head is a non-operator change: affected-only skips operator, buildSha never moves, and BOTH workflows report `completed/success`. Find the real target with `git log --oneline <sha> -- nodes/operator/app` and flight THAT commit; verify in the VM Postgres (`SELECT max(id) FROM drizzle."__drizzle_migrations"`), never by workflow conclusion. Seen 2026-08-07: seed `0040` (#1978/`3c4f256`) reached preview+prod only after flighting `3c4f256`, not main head `a5f63fb` (#1980, provision-only). See `/provision-env` gotcha 21.

### Admin-merge gotcha (bug.0443)

Admin-merging bypasses `merge_group` → no `mq-*` images → `flight-preview.yml`'s "Hard-fail when no images found for resolved PR" step fires. Same recovery: ship a follow-up PR through merge-queue. Do NOT try to dispatch a deleted `build-multi-node.yml`.

## Production promotion

Explicit, RBAC-gated, operator-dispatched. There is no production auto-trigger (`promote-to-production.yml` was removed in bug.0361).

```bash
# nodeId from the operator nodes registry; sourceSha optional (operator resolves
# the catalog-pinned digest). Bearer key — NEVER a personal gh credential.
curl -sS -X POST "$BASE/api/v1/deploy/promote" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $COGNI_API_KEY" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"nodeId":"<node-uuid>","env":"production"}'
# 200 {"dispatched":true,...} → operator GitHub App dispatched promote-and-deploy.
# 403 authz_denied → request can_promote_production (grant loop, top of file).
```

`APP_PROMOTE_IS_NO_INFRA`: the API hard-sets `skip_infra=true` — promotion reconciles the **app digest only**. Per-node ESO `ExternalSecret`s are still materialized by the ungated `node-substrate` lane, so no-infra does **not** skip secret reconciliation. A substrate change (`infra/compose/**`, a VM-materialized OpenBao/ESO bridge secret, or edge/runtime topology) needs the **infra lever** — an operator-internal action, never an app promotion, and never a personal `gh workflow run … -f skip_infra=false`.

After dispatch, **always** confirm production `/version.buildSha` actually advanced — see Monitoring. Discover the dispatched run via the unauthenticated GitHub API (`GET /repos/Cogni-DAO/cogni/actions/workflows/promote-and-deploy.yml/runs`); no personal token required.

## Monitoring — Monitor tool, not eyeballing

Every promotion gets a Monitor armed before you walk away. The pattern emits one line per state change so you don't have to poll. Cover ALL terminal states (success, failure, cancelled, hung) — silence is not success.

```bash
# Copy-paste template. Set TARGET_SHA, FLIGHT_ID, and HOSTS for the env.
TARGET_SHA=<expected-buildsha-40-chars>
SHORT=${TARGET_SHA:0:12}
FLIGHT_ID=<flight-preview-or-promote-deploy-run-id-you-just-dispatched>
HOSTS="https://preview.cognidao.org https://poly-preview.cognidao.org https://resy-preview.cognidao.org"
# Self-discover the dispatch time so we can find the chained promote-and-deploy run.
DISPATCH_AT=$(gh run view "$FLIGHT_ID" --json createdAt --jq .createdAt)
PD_ID=""
prev_flight="" prev_pd=""
declare -A prev_bs=()
echo "watching flight=$FLIGHT_ID target=$SHORT hosts=$HOSTS dispatched=$DISPATCH_AT"
deadline=$(( $(date +%s) + 2400 ))
while [ "$(date +%s)" -lt "$deadline" ]; do
  fs=$(gh run view "$FLIGHT_ID" --json status,conclusion --jq '"\(.status)/\(.conclusion)"' 2>/dev/null || echo "api-fail/")
  [ "$fs" != "$prev_flight" ] && echo "[flight $FLIGHT_ID] $fs" && prev_flight="$fs"
  if [ -z "$PD_ID" ]; then
    PD_ID=$(gh run list --workflow=promote-and-deploy.yml --limit 5 --json databaseId,createdAt \
      --jq "[.[] | select(.createdAt > \"$DISPATCH_AT\")] | .[0].databaseId // empty" 2>/dev/null || echo "")
    [ -n "$PD_ID" ] && echo "[discovered promote-and-deploy] $PD_ID"
  fi
  if [ -n "$PD_ID" ]; then
    ps=$(gh run view "$PD_ID" --json status,conclusion --jq '"\(.status)/\(.conclusion)"' 2>/dev/null || echo "api-fail/")
    [ "$ps" != "$prev_pd" ] && echo "[promote-deploy $PD_ID] $ps" && prev_pd="$ps"
  fi
  all_match=1
  for host in $HOSTS; do
    bs=$(curl -sk --max-time 8 "$host/version" 2>/dev/null \
          | python3 -c 'import json,sys
try: print(json.loads(sys.stdin.read()).get("buildSha","")[:12])
except: print("")' 2>/dev/null || echo "")
    if [ "$bs" != "${prev_bs[$host]:-}" ]; then
      echo "[$host /version buildSha] ${bs:-<empty>}"
      prev_bs[$host]=$bs
    fi
    [ "$bs" = "$SHORT" ] || all_match=0
  done
  if [ "$all_match" = "1" ]; then
    echo "[DONE] all hosts match $SHORT"
    exit 0
  fi
  sleep 30
done
echo "[TIMEOUT] flight=$prev_flight promote=$prev_pd buildshas=$(declare -p prev_bs)"
exit 2
```

Wrap in a `Monitor` tool call with `timeout_ms` 2400000 (40 min) and a descriptive name like `"heal preview-operator: flight {ID} → promote-deploy → all preview /version → {SHORT}"`.

### When `/version.buildSha` doesn't advance — Loki, not SSH

`/version.buildSha` answers "is the new app pod serving" but says nothing
about why a host-side compose container (alloy, autoheal, db-backup,
alloy-k8s-events) is crash-looping. Don't SSH-tail. Both layers ship to the
same Loki:

```logql
# 1. App pod startup / env validation (k3s pod logs)
{namespace="cogni-<env>",pod=~"<service>-.*"} |~ "Error|EnvValidation|panic|started|ready"

# 2. Host-side compose container stdout (host alloy → Loki)
{env="<env>",service="<compose-svc>"} | json | level=~"error|warn"
# compose-svc ∈ {litellm, caddy, temporal, autoheal, db-backup, alloy-k8s-events}

# 3. Kubernetes Events stream (pod OOMKilled, probe failures, evictions, rollout)
{env="<env>",source="k8s-events"} | json
# Use this when a node restarted but app stderr is empty — kubelet's reason
# (OOMKilled, ImagePullBackOff, Liveness probe failed) only lives in events,
# not in container logs.

# 4. Argo control-plane — "a node's app never appeared" / "stuck OutOfSync"
{namespace="argocd",source="k8s-events",kind="ApplicationSet"} | json
# msg: created/Deleted Application "<env>-<node>" — proves the AppSet IS
# generating (a `created`+`Deleted` pair on the same app = it generated then
# pruned: a catalog/overlay condition, NOT a stuck controller).
{namespace="argocd",source="k8s-events",kind="Application",reason=~"OperationStarted|OperationCompleted|Failed"} | json
# msg: "Initiated automated sync to <sha>" → "sync operation to <sha> succeeded"
# — Argo's reconcile state for that one app, by sha.
```

`source="k8s-events"` requires the `alloy-k8s-events` compose service from
PR #1233 to be deployed in the env you're querying. If empty: check
`{service="alloy-k8s-events", env="<env>"}` for crash logs first.

**Reaching for `kubectl get applications` / `kubectl describe applicationset`
is the anti-pattern.** The `applicationset-controller` and
`application-controller` emit every generate / create / prune / sync
transition as a k8s Event — already in Loki via stream #4 above. `kind=ApplicationSet`
answers "is the AppSet generating this node's app at all"; `kind=Application`
answers "is Argo syncing it to the expected sha." No SSH, no kubeconfig — which
is also the SOC2 posture (read-only, audited, zero standing cluster credential).
Verified 2026-06-02: the `candidate-a-wisp` "AppSet won't generate" report was
false — Loki showed the controller had `created` then `Deleted` the Application.

New compose services don't ship logs until added to the host-alloy allowlist
regex in `infra/compose/runtime/configs/alloy-config.{,metrics.}alloy`. If
`{service=<svc>}` returns silence post-deploy, fix the regex before
diagnosing further — it's not Loki, it's the filter.

## Preview is latest-wins (no lease)

There is **no preview review-lease** (removed 2026-06-16, `kill-preview-review-lease`). Every merge to main dispatches a fresh preview flight; the latest one wins. There is nothing to "unlock" and no `reviewing` hold to wait on — preview always tracks the latest merged SHA. Serialization under bursty merges is handled by the `flight-preview` and `promote-deploy-<env>-<nodes>` workflow concurrency groups. If preview looks stale, it's an affected-only or admin-merge image gap (see the two gotchas above) or a failed flight — not a lease; re-merge or re-dispatch `flight-preview.yml`.

## Failure modes — first-step diagnosis

## Discipline

- **`/version.buildSha` is the only deploy verification that matters.** CI conclusions can lie. `/readyz` can lie (old pod answers during rolling cutover).
- **Per-node truth, not per-workflow.** Every promotion advances _some_ nodes, not necessarily all. Check each `deploy/<env>-<node>:.promote-state/current-sha` independently.
- **Admin-merge breaks the pipeline.** If you see a CD-affecting PR getting admin-merged, file a bug AND propose a merge-queue follow-up; don't pretend the resulting silent-skip will heal itself.
- **Don't dispatch without arming a Monitor.** Fire-and-forget is how outages survive shift changes.
- **Catalog-as-SSOT for target lists.** Source `scripts/ci/lib/image-tags.sh`; never inline `(operator poly resy scheduler-worker)`.
- **Promotion runs as the operator, never personal `gh`.** Flight/promote via the API (`vcs/flight`, `deploy/promote`); the operator GitHub App dispatches. `gh workflow run` of a promote/flight uses a personal credential and is out of bounds. Read-only `gh run view/list` for watching a run is fine.
