/**
 * Module: `@tests/ci-invariants/promote-provenance-wiring`
 * Purpose: Pins how the promote workflow feeds source provenance into `resolve_remote_source_sha`. bug.5195 defect #2 was WIRING, not the resolver: the raw `inputs.source_sha` is empty on the product-contract promote, so it read as ABSENT authority.
 * Scope: Static YAML read of one workflow file. Does NOT contact a cluster, dispatch a run, or re-test the resolver itself.
 * Invariants:
 *   - AUTHORITY_IS_THE_RESOLVED_HEAD: every consumer gets `decide.outputs.head_sha`.
 *     `decide` sets head_sha = source_sha ?: github.sha and `app-src` is checked out AT
 *     head_sha, so that commit IS the one whose catalog source_sha was read. An explicit
 *     sourceSha resolves identically, because then head_sha == inputs.source_sha.
 *   - EVERY_CONSUMER_AGREES: the digest job and node-substrate must resolve the SAME
 *     revision. Two different provenances is the bug.5043 split-brain that
 *     verify-buildsha cannot catch, because it self-confirms the pin it wrote.
 * Side-effects: IO (reads the workflow file)
 * Links: bug.5195, scripts/ci/lib/image-tags.sh (resolve_remote_source_sha),
 *   scripts/ci/tests/resolve-remote-source-sha.test.sh
 * @public
