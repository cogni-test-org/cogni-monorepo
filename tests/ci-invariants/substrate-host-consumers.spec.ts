/**
 * Module: `@tests/ci-invariants/substrate-host-consumers`
 * Purpose: Enforces SUBSTRATE_HOST_IS_CONTROL_ENV_SCOPED (bug.5206) — the shared substrate a
 *   workload dials belongs to the cluster that RECONCILES the lane, not the lane it is named
 *   after, so no consumer may derive it from the workload env alone.
 * Scope: Static grep over the deploy actions/workflows/scripts that build a substrate host; does not execute them, resolve YAML, hit the network, or verify the host resolves.
 * Invariants:
 *   VM_HOST_FOR_ENV_TAKES_A_RESOLVED_ENV: `vm_host_for_env` is never called with a raw
 *     workload-env variable; its first argument must be a control-env-resolved value.
 * Side-effects: IO (reads .github/, scripts/)
 * Links: scripts/ci/lib/appset-paths.sh (control_env_for), bug.5206, task.5132
 * @public
