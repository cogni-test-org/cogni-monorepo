/**
 * Module: `@tests/ci-invariants/classify`
 * Purpose: Reference TypeScript implementation of the single-node-scope policy.
 *          Mirrors the bash logic in `.github/workflows/ci.yaml#single-node-scope`
 *          and is the surface task.0382's runtime resolver must match.
 * Scope: Pure function used by parity tests. Does NOT read the filesystem or invoke git.
 * Invariants: SINGLE_DOMAIN_HARD_FAIL, OPERATOR_IS_A_NODE, RIDE_ALONG (see work/items/task.0381.* §Invariants).
 * Side-effects: none
 * Notes: When task.0382 lands, it should import this same function (or replicate
 *        it identically) and run the same fixtures.
 * Links: tests/ci-invariants/fixtures/single-node-scope/, work/items/task.0382.*

 * → Dolt). Adding to this list weakens the gate; do so deliberately.
 *
 * - `pnpm-lock.yaml`: mechanical side-effect of node-level package.json edits.
 * - `work/**`: per-task work items, projects, charters; high merge-conflict +
 *   index-regen churn. Ride-along until task tracking moves to Dolt.
 * - `docs/**`: cross-cutting prose updates that accompany a node change.
 * - `.claude/skills/**`: agent-facing skill docs that frequently codify the
 *   exact principle a node-scoped fix demonstrates. Treat like docs/ —
 *   prose that travels with the implementing code.
 * - Exact single-node-scope policy maintenance files: the workflow gate,
 *   reference classifier, repo-spec resolver, parity fixtures, and narrow tests.
