# Production Operator ESO Cutover

Use this when production operator is being moved from the legacy
`operator-node-app-secrets` bridge to OpenBao-sourced `operator-env-secrets`.

Before changing secrets or deploy behavior, read
[`cicd-secrets-expert`](../../.claude/skills/cicd-secrets-expert/SKILL.md).
That skill is the short-form contract for OpenBao/ESO vs GitHub env secrets,
writer-role auth, entry points, and the anti-patterns this runbook avoids.

## Current Cutover State

As of 2026-06-07, production has the OpenBao/ESO substrate. Live checks against
the provision artifact kubeconfig showed the ESO CRDs, `ClusterSecretStore
openbao-backend Ready=True`, and `ExternalSecret/operator-env-secrets
Ready=True`.

An older promote reported `ExternalSecret` CRD missing. Treat that class of
message as an ambiguous Argo/workflow signal until live cluster checks confirm
current CRDs, store readiness, and ExternalSecret readiness. The 2026-06-07
operator incident was a config-vs-secret mistake plus stale pod env:
env-scoped deployment-parent config belongs in `operator-node-app-config`, not
OpenBao, and the pod must roll before `process.env` sees a ConfigMap change.

The production gate is now: substrate ready, `operator-env-secrets Ready=True`,
deployment consumes `operator-node-app-config` + `operator-env-secrets`, the
running process has required keys, then public `/readyz` and `/version`.

## CI/CD Reliability Gate

This runbook is a deployment control. The cutover has four gates:

- production app changes use `promote-and-deploy.yml` with `nodes=operator` and
  `skip_infra=true` unless the PR changes Compose/runtime infra;
- production substrate readiness is proven by live Kubernetes API checks for the
  ESO CRDs, `external-secrets` controllers, and `ClusterSecretStore`;
- runtime readiness is proven by `ExternalSecret/operator-env-secrets
Ready=True`, then public `/readyz` and `/version.buildSha`;
- legacy bridge cleanup is delayed until production serves the expected build
  SHA and rollback custody is closed.

These gates remove the ambiguous state where GitHub environment secrets,
Compose deploy-infra, and OpenBao/ESO all appear to manage the same operator
runtime values.

## Rules

- Do not declare "no kube/SSH access" until you have checked the primary clone's
  durable `.local/` directory and the provision init artifacts.
- Do not print secret values. List file names, permissions, sizes, and command
  success only.
- Do not use `.local/<env>-openbao-root-token` for day-2 writes. Use the
  Kubernetes writer role or a production-approved workflow path.
- Do not delete stale VM keys or old `.local` material until production is
  serving the expected `/version.buildSha` and the rollback window is closed.
- Do not run a full infra promote for an app-only cutover unless the PR changes
  Compose/runtime infra. Use `skip_infra=true` when only k8s app manifests and
  OpenBao data are changing.
- Do not treat `nodes=operator` as making `deploy-infra` operator-scoped. The
  `deploy-infra` job is environment-level; unless `k8s-secrets-only` is
  explicitly selected, it reconciles Compose and the legacy k8s secret bridge.

## Access Discovery

Conductor workspaces are git worktrees; they usually do not contain `.local/`.
Look in the operator's primary clone before reporting a blocker:

```bash
PRIMARY_CLONE="${COGNI_PRIMARY_CLONE:-$HOME/dev/cogni-template}"

test -d "$PRIMARY_CLONE/.local" || {
  echo "missing primary .local: $PRIMARY_CLONE/.local"
  exit 1
}

find "$PRIMARY_CLONE/.local" -maxdepth 1 -type f \
  \( -name 'production-*' -o -name 'preview-*' -o -name 'candidate-a-*' \) \
  -print0 | xargs -0 ls -l
```

Expected production files when this laptop is the provisioner:

```text
.local/production-vm-key
.local/production-vm-ip
.local/production-init-passphrase.txt
```

If present, prefer these local Kubernetes custody files:

```text
.local/production-kubeconfig.yaml
.local/production-openbao-init.json
```

If they are absent, check the GitHub Actions init artifact before declaring the
environment unrecoverable:

```bash
gh api repos/Cogni-DAO/cogni/actions/artifacts \
  --jq '.artifacts[] | select(.name=="production-init-artifacts") | [.id,.created_at,.expired] | @tsv'
```

Only decrypt artifacts into `.local/` with the matching
`.local/production-init-passphrase.txt`, then `chmod 600` the kubeconfig, VM key,
and OpenBao init JSON. A clean decrypt is not enough; validate credentials
against the live cluster before trusting them.

## Preflight

1. Confirm the PR renders the production operator overlay with exactly one
   operator ExternalSecret and no legacy `operator-node-app-secrets` references:

   ```bash
   kubectl kustomize infra/k8s/overlays/production/operator \
     | tee /tmp/production-operator.yaml >/dev/null

   rg -n 'kind: ExternalSecret|operator-env-secrets|operator-node-app-secrets' \
     /tmp/production-operator.yaml
   ```

2. Confirm public production is healthy before touching the cutover:

   ```bash
   curl -fsS https://cognidao.org/readyz
   curl -fsS https://cognidao.org/version
   ```

3. Confirm OpenBao access uses a short-lived role token, not the root token:

   ```bash
   export KUBECONFIG="$PRIMARY_CLONE/.local/production-kubeconfig.yaml"
   kubectl get ns openbao

   kubectl -n openbao port-forward svc/openbao 8200:8200 &
   export BAO_ADDR=http://127.0.0.1:8200
   export BAO_TOKEN="$(
     bao write -field=token auth/kubernetes/login \
       role=production-writer \
       jwt="$(kubectl create token openbao-operator -n default)"
   )"
   bao token lookup -self >/dev/null
   ```

If production lacks a local kubeconfig but has only `production-vm-key`, record
that exact state. The key is legacy custody material, not proof that the normal
day-2 OpenBao write path exists.

## Edge And Cert Custody

The production TLS certificates are owned by the edge Caddy stack, not by the
operator pod and not by OpenBao:

```text
/opt/cogni-template-edge/docker-compose.yml
docker volume cogni-edge_caddy_data   -> Caddy /data
docker volume cogni-edge_caddy_config -> Caddy /config
```

Do not prune `cogni-edge_caddy_data` or `cogni-edge_caddy_config` during key
cleanup. They persist ACME material and Caddy config state. See
[`infra/compose/edge/AGENTS.md`](../../infra/compose/edge/AGENTS.md) for the
edge-stack contract.

## Substrate Gate

Before applying or waiting on `operator-env-secrets`, prove production has the
ESO CRDs and store:

```bash
kubectl get crd externalsecrets.external-secrets.io
kubectl get crd clustersecretstores.external-secrets.io
kubectl get clustersecretstore openbao-backend
kubectl -n external-secrets get deploy external-secrets external-secrets-webhook
```

If any of these are absent, do not rerun `deploy-infra` as a substitute. Reconcile
the OpenBao/ESO substrate first using the provisioned Argo Applications or the
environment bootstrap path, then continue with seeding and force-sync.

If a workflow failed with a missing-CRD message, run this gate before acting on
the failure. Argo status can preserve an earlier sync failure; live CRD/store
checks decide whether substrate is currently absent.

## Seed

Seed `cogni/production/operator` with the operator runtime values already
approved for production. Use the CLI or the per-operation workflow when it
exists; do not paste values into chat, PRs, or workflow inputs.

```bash
pnpm secrets:set production operator GH_REVIEW_APP_ID
pnpm secrets:set production operator GH_REVIEW_APP_PRIVATE_KEY_BASE64
pnpm secrets:set production operator GH_WEBHOOK_SECRET
pnpm secrets:set production operator AUTH_SECRET
pnpm secrets:set production operator DATABASE_URL
pnpm secrets:set production operator DOLTGRES_URL
```

Adjust the key list to the catalog. The invariant is that every key consumed by
the production operator pod exists at `cogni/production/operator` before the
Deployment switches to `operator-env-secrets`.

## Force Sync

After the PR's ExternalSecret manifest is applied by the production deploy
branch, force one ESO reconcile:

```bash
kubectl -n cogni-production annotate externalsecret operator-env-secrets \
  force-sync="$(date +%s)" --overwrite

kubectl -n cogni-production wait externalsecret/operator-env-secrets \
  --for=condition=Ready=True --timeout=120s

kubectl -n cogni-production get secret operator-env-secrets
```

The wait must report `Ready=True`. Do not inspect or print Secret values.

## Config And Process Proof

Non-secret env-scoped values live in `operator-node-app-config`, not OpenBao.
Do not use the secret guide or `pnpm secrets:set` for these keys. Prove the
ConfigMap, deployment wiring, and live process separately:

```bash
kubectl -n cogni-production get configmap operator-node-app-config \
  -o jsonpath='{.data.NODE_SUBMODULE_PARENT_OWNER}{"\n"}{.data.NODE_SUBMODULE_PARENT_REPO}{"\n"}'

kubectl -n cogni-production get deploy operator-node-app \
  -o jsonpath='{.spec.template.spec.containers[0].envFrom}{"\n"}'

POD=$(kubectl -n cogni-production get pod \
  -l app.kubernetes.io/name=node-app,app.kubernetes.io/instance=operator \
  -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}')
kubectl -n cogni-production exec "$POD" -- sh -c \
  'test -n "$NODE_SUBMODULE_PARENT_OWNER" && test -n "$NODE_SUBMODULE_PARENT_REPO"'
```

ConfigMap and Secret env vars are read at pod start. If the process is stale,
roll through GitOps when time allows; in an incident, record any direct
`rollout restart` and verify Argo returns `Synced` / `Healthy`.

## Promote

For an app-only production operator ESO cutover, dispatch production promotion
from `main` with infra skipped:

```bash
SOURCE_SHA=<main-sha-containing-the-cutover>

gh workflow run promote-and-deploy.yml --repo Cogni-DAO/cogni --ref main \
  -f environment=production \
  -f source_sha="$SOURCE_SHA" \
  -f build_sha="$SOURCE_SHA" \
  -f nodes=operator \
  -f skip_infra=true
```

Use `skip_infra=false` only when the PR also changes Compose/runtime infra that
must be reconciled for the cutover. Watch the workflow to terminal state and
then verify from outside the cluster:

```bash
curl -fsS https://cognidao.org/readyz
curl -fsS https://cognidao.org/version
```

`/readyz` proves service health. `/version.buildSha` proves the new operator pod
is serving.

## Rollback

If `operator-env-secrets` is not `Ready=True`, do not promote. Fix the OpenBao
path, role, or ExternalSecret first.

If promotion completes but production is not serving the expected build SHA,
roll back by promoting the prior known-good production operator digest through
the same deploy branch and workflow. Do not repair production with direct
`kubectl edit` or a hand-written Secret.

## Cleanup Last

Only after production is healthy on the expected build SHA and the rollback
window is closed:

1. Inventory stale `.local` material and old VM keys.
2. Confirm no active workflow or rollback path depends on them.
3. Revoke or rotate obsolete VM SSH keys.
4. Remove destroyed-VM local files from the primary clone.
5. Update the work item or PR with the cleanup evidence.

This cleanup is intentionally last. During a production cutover, custody and
rollback beat tidiness.
