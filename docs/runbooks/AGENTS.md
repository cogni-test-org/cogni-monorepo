## Public Surface

- **Exports:** none
- **Files considered API:** `*.md` runbook documents

## Responsibilities

- This directory **does**: Document operational procedures and incident response
- This directory **does not**: Contain executable scripts or configurations

## Usage

Minimal local commands:

```bash
# Reference only - no executable commands
```

## Standards

- Step-by-step procedures with clear prerequisites
- Include troubleshooting sections for common issues
- Reference specific commands and environment variables

## Change Protocol

- Update this file when **new runbooks** are added
- Bump **Last reviewed** date
- Update runbooks when deployment procedures change

## Notes

- Documentation only - executable scripts belong in ../ci/scripts/
- Procedures should be tested and validated with actual deployments
