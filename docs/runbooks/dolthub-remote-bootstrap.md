# DoltHub Mirror — One-Time Bootstrap

> Filed by task.5069 (v0 knowledge mirror). Successor's responsibility: do **this** once per cluster lifecycle, never again.

## Why this exists

The webapp pushes the canonical knowledge branch to DoltHub after every successful contribution merge. DoltHub's push protocol does **not** accept Personal Access Tokens — it requires a **Dolt cred** (cryptographic keypair). This file documents the one-time setup that gives the doltgres container a valid cred.

The end state: the webapp owns 100% of runtime push/pull. This bootstrap is the only manual step, and the agent picking up task.5069 is the one who runs it. Derek doesn't do it.

## What's automated vs. manual (truth, after the 2026-05-28 spike)

This is the only remaining manual step. |

`dolt creds check` against an unregistered key confirms the gating mechanism: `rpc error: code = Unauthenticated desc = jwt_token validation failed: key not found`. The keypair exists locally and in the doltgres container; DoltHub's auth subsystem doesn't recognize it until the pubkey is registered.

## Spike findings underlying this design

- DoltHub docs (`/docs/products/dolthub/api/authentication`): API tokens authenticate the **REST/SQL HTTP API only** ("over Basic Authentication").
- DoltHub docs (`/docs/products/dolthub/api/database`): `POST /api/v1alpha1/database` accepts PAT and creates a repo — earlier handoff was wrong about "no REST endpoint for repo creation." The endpoint exists, takes `{ownerName, repoName, description, visibility}`, returns `{status:"Success",...}`.
- Dolt docs (`/docs/cli-reference/cli`): `dolt creds` "Create a new public/private keypair for authenticating with doltremoteapi." Pubkey is registered in DoltHub settings; privkey signs the push handshake.
- DoltHub's GRPC remote (`doltremoteapi.dolthub.com`) returns the same `PermissionDenied` for "no such repo" AND "wrong auth" — so spike attempts against nonexistent repos cannot distinguish. Full e2e validation requires both the repo and the cred to exist.

## Prerequisites for the agent running this

- `dolt` CLI installed on a bootstrap host (your laptop, a one-shot container, anywhere you can run a Go binary). Doltgres does **not** ship the `dolt` CLI, so the keypair must be generated externally.
- A DoltHub account that owns the `cogni-dao` organization (or has admin rights).
- `gh` CLI authenticated and able to write GitHub Environment Secrets in `Cogni-DAO/cogni`.

## Step 1 — Create the DoltHub repo (per node hub) — AUTOMATABLE via REST

DoltHub exposes `POST /api/v1alpha1/database` with PAT auth (confirmed 2026-05-28). Repo creation does NOT require the UI.

For the operator node specifically:

```bash
# DOLTHUB_API_TOKEN must be exported (it lives in .env.operator locally and
# in GitHub Environment Secrets for the deployed envs).
curl -sS -X POST \
  -H "authorization: token $DOLTHUB_API_TOKEN" \
  -H "content-type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "ownerName": "cogni-dao",
    "repoName": "knowledge-operator",
    "description": "Cogni operator knowledge mirror",
    "visibility": "public"
  }' \
  "https://www.dolthub.com/api/v1alpha1/database"

# Expected: {"status":"Success","repository_owner":"cogni-dao","repository_name":"knowledge-operator",...}
# Idempotency: re-running returns "Error: database already exists" — safe to ignore.
```

The node wizard now performs this repo-creation call automatically during node
publish for every spawned node. It uses the environment's `DOLTHUB_API_TOKEN`
and explicit `DOLTHUB_OWNER`, derives `repoName = knowledge-<node>`, and writes
the resulting environment-owned mirror into the node's repo-spec:

```yaml
knowledge:
  database: "knowledge_<node>"
  remote:
    provider: dolthub
    owner: "cogni-dao"
    repo: "knowledge-<node>"
    url: "https://doltremoteapi.dolthub.com/cogni-dao/knowledge-<node>"
    custody: cogni-owned
```

Each GitHub Environment must set the non-secret variable `DOLTHUB_OWNER`.
Production uses `cogni-dao`; candidate/test/preview must use a non-production
DoltHub org. The app fails closed when `DOLTHUB_API_TOKEN` is present without
`DOLTHUB_OWNER` so test traffic cannot silently create repos under production.
Users never create their own DoltHub repos in v0.

Verification:

```bash
curl -sS -H "authorization: token $DOLTHUB_API_TOKEN" \
  "https://www.dolthub.com/api/v1alpha1/cogni-dao/knowledge-operator/main?q=SELECT+1"
# Expect: {"query_execution_status":"Success",...} (or a structured Dolt schema response)
```

## Step 2 — Generate the Dolt cred

On the bootstrap host:

```bash
dolt creds new
```

Output looks like:

```
Credentials created successfully.
pub key: <pubkey-hex>
0 of 1 keys associated with this account
Run dolt creds use <keyid> to associate this credential with your account.
```

The keyid is also the filename:

```bash
ls ~/.dolt/creds/
# <keyid>.jwk
```

Capture **both**:

- `keyid` — alphanumeric, ~52 chars
- contents of `~/.dolt/creds/<keyid>.jwk` — single-line JSON, ~few hundred bytes

## Step 3 — Register the pubkey with DoltHub

1. https://www.dolthub.com/settings/credentials
2. Paste the pubkey from `dolt creds new` output.
3. Confirm it appears in the list.

This pubkey is the **service identity** for the operator-app's push job. It is not Derek's personal cred; it belongs to the operator service for as long as v0 lives. Rotation = repeat Steps 2–3 with a new keypair and update the secrets.

## Step 4 — Set the GitHub Environment Secrets (push auth)

Runtime chooses the mirror remote from repo-spec `knowledge.remote.url` only.
There is no `DOLTHUB_REMOTE_URL` env override. `DOLT_CREDS_JWK` and
`DOLT_CREDS_KEYID` authenticate the Dolt push protocol for whichever
environment-owned repo the node repo-spec declares.

```bash
REPO=Cogni-DAO/cogni
KEYID=<keyid from step 2>
JWK=$(cat ~/.dolt/creds/$KEYID.jwk)

for ENV in candidate-a preview production; do
  gh secret set DOLT_CREDS_JWK   --repo $REPO --env $ENV --body "$JWK"
  gh secret set DOLT_CREDS_KEYID --repo $REPO --env $ENV --body "$KEYID"
done
```

Gate model: repo-spec presence only. The app wires `pushMainOnMerge` if and
only if `knowledge.remote.url` exists in the running node's repo-spec. The
environment boundary is the repo-spec URL minted during node publish:
production uses `cogni-dao`; candidate/test/preview use the non-production
DoltHub owner configured by `DOLTHUB_OWNER`.

The bootstrap host can now delete its local `~/.dolt/creds/<keyid>.jwk` — the cluster has the only authoritative copy.

> **OpenBao is the runtime SSOT (Option B, `feat/dolt-creds-substrate-materialize`).**
> The GH-env `gh secret set` above is the provision-time seed. At runtime the creds
> live in OpenBao at `cogni/<env>/operator` (materialized by `secret-materialize.sh`
> from the catalog `_shared` entries — they are already in `NODE_BASELINE_KEYS`), and
> the **always-run substrate lane** (`reconcile-node-substrate.sh`, ci-cd.md Axiom 22)
> reads them via the read-only `<env>-db-reader` token and renders them into the VM
> runtime `.env` + force-recreates doltgres on change. This means **a normal app
> promote materializes the mirror creds — no separate `deploy-infra` run is required.**
> For a fresh env the whole enablement is: (1) paste the DoltHub `_shared` secrets once
> via THE PATH (`POST /api/v1/nodes/{id}/secrets` or provision), (2) a normal promote.
> Fail-closed: absent `DOLT_CREDS_JWK`/`KEYID` ⇒ the mirror stays disabled
> (`install-creds.sh` no-ops), never a hardcoded fallback.

## Step 5 — Verify (after the next flight or promote)

After **any** candidate-flight OR promote-and-deploy for the operator node runs on a
branch that includes this PR (the substrate lane runs on every one — an infra flight is
no longer required; the legacy `candidate-flight-infra.yml` path still works too):

```bash
# SSH into the candidate-a VM
ssh root@<candidate-a-vm>
docker exec -it cogni-runtime-doltgres-1 ls -la /root/.dolt/creds/
# Should show <keyid>.jwk with perms 0600
docker exec -it cogni-runtime-doltgres-1 cat /root/.dolt/config_global.json
# Should show "user.creds":"<keyid>" alongside server_uuid
```

End-to-end push validation: merge any contribution via the inbox UI on candidate-a, then watch Loki for `msg="dolthub_push_ok"`. If you see `msg="dolthub_push_failed"`, the structured error includes the repo-spec remote URL and the SQL error — usually means either the repo wasn't created (Step 1), the pubkey wasn't registered (Step 3), or the JWK was pasted truncated.

When repo-spec has no `knowledge.remote`, the push job is silently disabled —
`pushMainOnMerge` is `undefined`, and merges succeed locally with no remote
attempt. This is the default for pre-knowledge/dev workspaces.

## Future work (v1+)

- **Service-account cred provisioning via OAuth client_credentials** — currently blocked on DoltHub OAuth app approval (task.5070). When approved, OAuth still won't sign push directly; it would need to mint a Dolt cred on behalf of the service. DoltHub does not expose this today.
- **Per-env separate creds** — for blast-radius isolation if any env's cred is compromised.
- **Repo reconciliation cron** — repo creation is now automated by `POST /api/v1alpha1/database`; a later reconciler can periodically verify every registered node still has its declared remote repo.

## Why this can't be 100% automated yet

**Only the pubkey registration step (Step 3) is a manual UI paste.** Everything else — repo creation, keypair generation, secret provisioning — can be scripted with the PAT alone. DoltHub does not expose a REST endpoint to add a credential to an account; we verified across `POST /credentials`, `/user/credentials`, `/keys`, `/user/keys`, `/creds`, `/user/creds`, both `www.dolthub.com` and `dolthubapi.dolthub.com`, plus GraphQL — all 404 or 400-only-GET. Until DoltHub ships this, the bootstrap is a single 30-second UI action.

**The 30-second walkthrough** (for the human running this):

1. Open https://www.dolthub.com/settings/credentials (sign in with the `cogni` DoltHub account if not already)
2. Paste the pubkey printed by `dolt creds new` (or extracted from `.context/dolthub-bootstrap/pubkey.txt` if the agent staged it for you)
3. Click "Save"
4. Tell the agent it's done. Next merge fires `dolthub_push_ok` in Loki.

The human can be any agent maintainer (not Derek specifically). The pubkey is a per-environment service identity, not anyone's personal cred.
