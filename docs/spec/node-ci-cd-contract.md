# Node CI/CD Contract

## Context

Node sovereignty is non-negotiable. CI must run from repo with zero operator dependencies. This spec defines what checks are required, which files are node-owned vs rails-eligible, and the ownership split between orchestration and policy.

## Goal

Define the CI/CD invariants, merge gate, and file ownership boundaries that ensure every node can run its full pipeline independently.

## Non-Goals

- Reusable workflow extraction (see [proj.ci-cd-reusable](../../work/projects/proj.ci-cd-reusable.md))
- Jenkins migration (gated on Dolt CI/CD requirements)

---

## Core Invariants

1. **FORK_FREEDOM**: CI runs without secrets; CD (build/deploy) is gated and skippable on forks.

2. **POLICY_STAYS_LOCAL**: ESLint/depcruise/prettier/tsconfig never centralized.

3. **LOCAL_GATE_PARITY**: `pnpm check` runs same assertions as CI, different execution (sequential vs parallel).

4. **NO_RUNTIME_FETCHES**: Workflows never fetch config from outside repo.

5. **SCRIPTS_ARE_THE_API**: Workflows orchestrate by calling named pnpm scripts; no inline command duplication. Targets logic _duplicated across ≥2 workflows_ — that must live in `scripts/` to prevent drift. Gate-specific inline policy that is small, unique to one workflow, and pinned by a meta-test is allowed; the `single-node-scope` job in `ci.yaml` is the canonical example.

6. **BUILD_ONCE_PROMOTE_DIGEST**: Images build on canary. Staging and production deploy the exact same digests. No per-environment rebuilds.

7. **SINGLE_RESPONSIBILITY**: Each workflow file owns one concern (build, promote+deploy, E2E+release). No monoliths.

8. **SINGLE_DOMAIN_HARD_FAIL**: PRs may touch exactly one node's domain. Each non-operator node owns `nodes/<X>/`; the operator node owns `nodes/operator/` plus everything else in the repo (infra, packages, .github, docs, work, scripts, root configs) as one domain. Cross-domain PRs are rejected by the `single-node-scope` job in `ci.yaml`. Bounded ride-along whitelist: `pnpm-lock.yaml` (mechanical side-effect of node-level `package.json` changes), `work/**` (per-task work items, projects, charters; ride-along until task tracking moves to Dolt), and `docs/**` (cross-cutting prose that accompanies a node change) may ride a single non-operator node PR. See `## Single-Domain Scope` below.

---

## Single-Domain Scope

Every path in the repo belongs to **exactly one node domain**. A PR may touch exactly one domain. This invariant is enforced statically by the `single-node-scope` job in `ci.yaml` (task.0381), and at review-time by `PrReviewWorkflow` via `extractOwningNode` (resolver: task.0382; consumer: task.0410). The reviewer fetches per-node rule files from `<owningNode.path>/.cogni/rules/` (resolved via `resolveRulePath` — single source of truth in `@cogni/repo-spec`), refuses cross-domain PRs with a diagnostic comment + neutral check (no AI tokens spent), and emits a structured `review.routed` log. Both implementations consume the same set of fixtures and must agree.

> **Routing-vs-policy principle.** Review **routing** is shared infrastructure (`packages/temporal-workflows`, `@cogni/repo-spec`). Review **policy** — rules, prompts, model selection — is per-node (`nodes/<X>/.cogni/`). Routing code never special-cases a particular node by string compare; the operator domain ships its rules at `nodes/operator/.cogni/rules/` like every other node. New review knobs land per-node first; promotions to shared infra require a spec update.

### Domains

```
4 disjoint domains. PR scope = exactly 1 column.

  ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐

  └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

The operator node's domain is broader because the operator IS the control plane — it owns the substrate every other node consumes. But it is still **one** domain, not an exemption.

### Rule

```
domain(path) = X         if path matches  nodes/<X>/**  for X ∈ {poly, resy, node-template}
             = operator   otherwise   (i.e., nodes/operator/** OR anywhere outside nodes/)

PR passes iff |distinct domains touched| ≤ 1, with the bounded ride-along whitelist below.
```

The set of non-operator domains is derived from the `nodes/*` directory listing minus `operator` — meta-tested in `tests/ci-invariants/single-node-scope-meta.spec.ts`. The repo-spec `nodes` registry must mirror the same set (enforced at the resolver boundary; meta-test asserts both directions). Adding `nodes/<X>/` requires updating the workflow filter list AND the registry — both meta-tests fire until they agree.

The dorny step must set `predicate-quantifier: 'every'` so the operator filter's `**` + `!nodes/<X>/**` negations actually subtract; under the default `some` quantifier the rules are OR'd and the negations are dead, which silently misclassifies every non-operator-node-only PR as that node + operator. Pinned by `single-node-scope-meta.spec.ts`.

### Ride-along exceptions

If `|S| = 2`, `operator ∈ S`, and **every** path matched by the operator filter is in the ride-along whitelist, the operator paths inherit the other domain and the PR passes.

Whitelist (must mirror `RIDE_ALONG_PATTERNS` in `tests/ci-invariants/classify.ts` and the inline `run:` block in `ci.yaml#single-node-scope`):

| Pattern          | Why                                                                                         | Long-term fix                                                             |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `pnpm-lock.yaml` | Mechanical side-effect of node-level `package.json` intent — not intent itself.             | Per-node lockfiles via pnpm `shared-workspace-lockfile=false`.            |
| `work/**`        | Per-task work items + projects + charters + auto-regenerated `_index.md`; high churn today. | Move task tracking to Dolt; `work/` empties out and exits the list.       |
| `docs/**`        | Cross-cutting prose that accompanies a node change (spec touch-ups, guide pointers).        | Migrate node-scoped docs into `nodes/<X>/docs/`; only operator docs left. |

Each entry has an explicit long-term fix that ends the ride-along. The whitelist is a v0 unblock, not a permanent carve-out — adding to it weakens the gate, so do so deliberately and pair the addition with the exit plan that drains the entry.

**Operator paths NOT in the whitelist (`.github`, `packages`, `infra`, `scripts`, root configs) do not ride along.** They are intent. A `poly` PR that needs an operator-spec change is two PRs, not one — that's the design.

### Why Reading A (operator-is-a-domain) over Reading B (operator-is-an-exemption)

The early flood of "node X needs operator change Y" PRs is the **substrate-request signal**, not noise. Each rejection by the gate is a row in operator's prioritization queue ("which seams are load-bearing? which need first-class APIs?"). Weakening the gate to absorb the friction loses that signal — operator never learns which substrates contributors actually push on. Same framing as the noisy-neighbor / attribution thesis: the boundary is where the test happens, not where the test is suppressed.

Sovereignty contracts only hold when the false-positive cost is accepted. Carving "reasonable exceptions" for the common case is the standard failure mode — within a year the boundary is theater. The ride-along whitelist is bounded specifically because each entry covers mechanical side-effects or transitional storage that is migrating out (work items → Dolt), not intent that belongs in operator's domain.

### Rejected — Reading B (operator-is-an-exemption)

`nodes/operator/**` and `packages/**`, `.github/**`, etc. classify as "infra" that rides along any single sovereign node. Rejected because **operator paths are intent, not side-effect; intent doesn't ride along.** A `poly` PR that needs an operator change is two PRs, not one — that's the design.

### Diagnostic contract — when the gate fires

Cross-domain rejections must do half the contributor's work in the failure annotation:

1. **Name the conflicting domains** explicitly (e.g., `poly + operator`, not just "scope error").
2. **Name the operator-territory paths** that triggered the operator domain match, when operator is one of the conflicting domains. The contributor needs to know which file they touched is "operator's intent."
3. **Suggest the split**: "file an operator PR with `<paths>` first; rebase your `<other-domain>` PR on it."
4. **Link the substrate-request convention** so the rejected change becomes a roadmap input rather than dropped friction. (Convention TBD; until it lands, link this spec section.)

Each gate firing is a feedback loop, not a barrier. Future: rejections logged structurally (Loki, work-item, attribution surface) so operator's roadmap-building agent reads the queue.

## Node-owned packages

The single-node-scope rule classifies any path outside `nodes/<X>/**` as `operator`. So a "shared" package at root that is in fact only consumed by one node turns every change to it into an `operator` PR — even though no operator code is touched. Carving such packages under `nodes/<X>/packages/` makes their domain match their actual ownership.

### Rule

A package is **node-owned** iff its only in-repo importer is `nodes/<X>/app`, `nodes/<X>/graphs`, or another `nodes/<X>/packages/<...>` package. Node-owned packages live at:

```
nodes/<X>/packages/<bare-name>/
```

Cross-node packages — anything imported by two or more nodes' `app`/`graphs` — stay at root `packages/`. If a package starts node-owned and later attracts a cross-node consumer, move it back to root in a single carve-back PR.

### Naming convention

Folder is the bare name (no `<node>-` prefix in the path); package name is `@cogni/<node>-<bare-name>`:

| Folder                                 | Package name                  |
| -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `nodes/poly/packages/wallet/`          | `@cogni/poly-wallet`          |
| `nodes/poly/packages/market-provider/` | `@cogni/poly-market-provider` |
| `nodes/poly/packages/node-contracts/`  | `@cogni/poly-node-contracts`  |
| `nodes/poly/packages/ai-tools/`        | `@cogni/poly-ai-tools`        |

The `<node>-` prefix on the package name is what makes ownership visible in `package.json` / lockfile / npm registry views; the path makes it visible in grep / file tree. Both signals point the same way.

### Workspace plumbing

Already wired:

- `pnpm-workspace.yaml` globs `nodes/*/packages/*`.
- `vitest.workspace.ts` includes `./nodes/*/packages/*/vitest.config.ts`.
- `pnpm packages:build` builds every `nodes/*/packages/*` and asserts each emits `dist/index.d.ts` (35 packages green as of task.0421).
- pnpm symlinks resolve `@cogni/*` automatically — no `tsconfig.json` `paths` aliases needed.

What a new node-owned package must do:

1. `package.json` — name `@cogni/<node>-<bare-name>`, same shape as existing peers (`exports`, `tsup`/`typecheck` scripts, `dist/` in `files`).
2. `tsconfig.json` — `composite: true`, `references` to any imported sibling packages (use `../../../../packages/<x>` or `../<sibling>` paths).
3. Add a `{ "path": "./nodes/<node>/packages/<bare-name>" }` entry to root `tsconfig.json` `references`.
4. Add the package to `biome/base.json` if it has any non-Biome-default config files (e.g. `tsup.config.ts`).
5. `AGENTS.md` mirroring the shared-package shape (Owners, Status, Boundaries JSON block, Public Surface, Responsibilities, Notes) — `pnpm check:docs` validates.

### Carve-out playbook

When moving an existing root package under a node:

1. Audit who imports it. `grep -rln "@cogni/<old-name>" --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" --include="*.json"`. If any non-target-node `app/package.json` declares it _without any code import_, that's a stale dep — drop it as a drive-by.
2. `git mv packages/<old-name> nodes/<node>/packages/<bare-name>`.
3. Rename the package: `package.json` `"name"` → `@cogni/<node>-<bare-name>`. Bulk find-replace the import name across the repo.
4. **Audit overlapping seds.** If you do two find-replaces whose results contain each other's targets (e.g. `s|packages/foo/|nodes/poly/packages/foo/|` after `s|../packages/foo/|../nodes/poly/packages/foo/|`), the second one re-prefixes the first's output. Always `grep -rln "nodes/<node>/nodes/<node>"` after a multi-sed pass.
5. **Audit fixture-relative paths in tests.** Tests that read `__dirname`-relative fixtures via `../../../docs/...` need extra `../` levels for the new depth. `pnpm exec vitest run nodes/<node>/packages/<bare-name>` catches these.
6. Update root `tsconfig.json` `references`, `biome/base.json` lint scopes, `.dependency-cruiser.cjs` rule paths.
7. **Importers with mixed symbols.** If splitting a package whose moved subset shares an `index.ts` with what stays behind, build the symbol allowlist from the moved files' actual exports — not from a name prefix. Files that import a mix get split into two `import { ... } from "@cogni/..."` statements.
8. **Re-exports too, not just imports.** `export { ... } from "<pkg>"` re-exports must also be redirected. Greppable with `from "@cogni/<old>"`.
9. `pnpm install` → `pnpm packages:build` → targeted `pnpm --filter @cogni/<new-name> typecheck` + targeted vitest run for the package and its consumers.
10. Drive-by stale-dep cleanup: drop `@cogni/<old-name>` declarations from any `app/package.json` that has no actual code importer.

### Drive-by-rule

When carving a package out, also remove its declaration from any `package.json` that doesn't actually import it. Stale workspace deps are silent landmines: they make `single-node-scope` think a node still consumes the package, and they make refactor-tooling slower for no reason.

### Per-node dep-cruiser is intentionally separate

This standard does not split `.dependency-cruiser.cjs` per node. That's a separate question (root-rules vs node-rules composition) tracked in [task.0422](../../work/items/task.0422.dep-cruiser-inter-intra-node-design.md) — pre-requires this carve-out so paths are stable before the dep-cruiser split lands.

## Design

### Merge Gate (Required for PR Merge)

| Check                                  | Local | CI                    |
| -------------------------------------- | ----- | --------------------- |
| `pnpm typecheck`                       | yes   | static job            |
| `pnpm lint`                            | yes   | static job            |
| `pnpm format:check`                    | yes   | unit job              |
| `pnpm test:ci` (unit/contract/meta)    | yes   | unit job              |
| `pnpm arch:check`                      | yes   | unit job              |
| `pnpm test:component`                  | yes   | component job         |
| **SINGLE_DOMAIN_HARD_FAIL** (PR scope) | no    | single-node-scope job |

**Optional** (not blocking): coverage upload, SonarCloud scan.

**Not a PR gate:** `pnpm test:stack:docker` (full-stack vitest) is **not** in `ci.yaml` and does **not** block PR merge. It lives in `stack-test.yml`, which is `workflow_dispatch`-only — too slow/flaky for per-PR runs. Run it ad-hoc per node: `gh workflow run stack-test.yml -f node=<node>` (empty `node` = every node with a `vitest.stack.config.mts`). Per-node integration coverage otherwise comes from candidate-a validation. (Note: `auto-merge-release-prs.yml` still lists `stack-test` as a required check for `release/*` PRs — a known stale gate, since the workflow never auto-fires.)

### Workflow Entrypoints

| File                     | Type | Secrets            | Trigger                                  | Concern                                           |
| ------------------------ | ---- | ------------------ | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `ci.yaml`                | CI   | No                 | PR; push main                            | typecheck, lint, unit, component (no stack-test)  |
| `stack-test.yml`         | CI   | No                 | workflow_dispatch                        | Per-node full-stack vitest (matrix over nodes)    |
| `build-multi-node.yml`   | CD   | Yes (GHCR)         | push canary                              | Build + push images                               |
| `promote-and-deploy.yml` | CD   | Yes (SSH, secrets) | workflow_run on build; workflow_dispatch | Promote overlays + deploy infra + verify          |
| `e2e.yml`                | CD   | Yes (PAT)          | workflow_run on promote-and-deploy       | E2E smoke + canary→staging promotion + release PR |
| `build-prod.yml`         | CD   | Yes (GHCR)         | push main                                | Build production images (legacy)                  |
| `deploy-production.yml`  | CD   | Yes (SSH, secrets) | workflow_run on build-prod               | Deploy to production (legacy)                     |

### Local Gates

| Command               | Script                        | Purpose                                                                  |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `pnpm check:fast`     | `scripts/check-fast.sh`       | Strict iteration gate (pre-push): verify-only, fails on any drift        |
| `pnpm check:fast:fix` | `scripts/check-fast.sh --fix` | Auto-fix variant: rewrites lint/format, fails if drift persists          |
| `pnpm check`          | `scripts/check-all.sh`        | Pre-commit gate: typecheck + lint + format + unit/contract + docs + arch |
| `pnpm check:full`     | `scripts/check-full.sh`       | CI parity: Docker build + stack + all test suites (~20 min)              |

### File Ownership Classification

**Node-Owned (Never Centralize):**

| Path                           | Why                         |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------- |
| `.dependency-cruiser.cjs`      | Hex architecture boundaries |
| `eslint.config.mjs`, `eslint/` | UI/chain governance rules   |
| `biome.json`, `biome/`         | Lint rules                  |
| `.prettierrc`                  | Formatting                  |
| `tsconfig*.json`               | Path aliases                |
| `scripts/check-*.sh`           | Local gate definitions      |
| `nodes/*/app/Dockerfile`       | Image definition            |

**Rails-Eligible (future extraction candidates):**

| Path                                 | Purpose               |
| ------------------------------------ | --------------------- |
| `.github/actions/loki-ci-telemetry/` | CI telemetry capture  |
| `.github/actions/loki-push/`         | Loki push             |
| `scripts/ci/build.sh`                | Docker build          |
| `scripts/ci/push.sh`                 | GHCR push             |
| `scripts/ci/test-image.sh`           | Image liveness test   |
| `scripts/ci/promote-k8s-image.sh`    | Overlay digest update |
| `scripts/ci/deploy-infra.sh`         | Compose infra deploy  |

**Ownership split:** Nodes own scripts and policy configs. Kit owns invocation conventions (when to call, how to parallelize, what to cache).

### Key Decisions

#### 1. Why Canary-First

Canary replaces staging as the primary integration branch. Benefits: multi-node testing from day one, k8s/Argo deployment model, build-once-promote-digest. Staging receives promoted digests, not fresh builds.

#### 2. Why In-Repo Seam First

Extracting to external repo too early causes version pinning overhead, false abstraction boundaries, and reduced iteration speed.

#### 3. Why Policy Stays Node-Owned

Centralizing lint/depcruise configs causes fork friction, policy fights, and loss of sovereignty. Rails kit provides orchestration defaults, not policy mandates.

## Repo Setup Fixture

Every Cogni node-template fork (and `node-template` itself) shares the same `main`-branch GitHub configuration: classic branch protection with a narrow required-status-checks set + GitHub Merge Queue. The canonical fixture lives in `infra/github/` and is applied via a single command:

```bash
bash infra/github/setup-main-branch.sh                      # current repo
bash infra/github/setup-main-branch.sh my-org/my-fork       # explicit repo
```

What the fixture establishes:

| Layer               | Source of truth                          | Apply mechanism                                                                                                                                              |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Repo merge settings | `setup-main-branch.sh` step 1            | `gh api PATCH /repos/{repo}` — squash-only, auto-merge on, delete-branch-on-merge                                                                            |
| Branch protection   | `infra/github/branch-protection.json`    | `gh api PUT /repos/{repo}/branches/main/protection` — required checks: `unit`, `component`, `static`, `manifest`                                             |
| Merge queue toggle  | `infra/github/merge-queue.json` (values) | **UI-only**: Settings → Branches → main → "Require merge queue" + form values. REST silently drops `required_merge_queue` (verified empirically 2026-04-28). |

The required-status-checks set is constrained by an empirical GitHub Merge Queue behavior: the queue waits forever for required checks whose workflows lack a `merge_group:` trigger. Full design + rationale in [`merge-queue-config.md`](./merge-queue-config.md), validated against `Cogni-DAO/test-repo` PR #53.

External-node-formation impact: a fresh fork clones, runs `setup-main-branch.sh`, clicks once in Settings → Branches, and is in lock-step with `Cogni-DAO/cogni`'s gate. No spelunking through Settings; no ad-hoc divergence.

## Acceptance Checks

**Automated:**

- `pnpm check` — local gate parity with CI
- Fork PRs pass CI without secrets

**Manual:**

1. Verify `ci.yaml` calls only pnpm scripts (no inline commands)
2. Verify CD workflows skip gracefully when secrets are missing (fork mode)
3. Verify canary E2E success triggers staging promotion without manual intervention
