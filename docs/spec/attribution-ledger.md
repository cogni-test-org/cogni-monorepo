# Attribution Ledger: Weekly Attribution Pipeline for Credit Statements

> The system is a **transparent activity-to-statement pipeline** with three plugin surfaces. Every week: (1) **source adapters** collect contribution activity from configured sources, (2) **epoch enrichers** produce typed evaluations from selected receipts (e.g., work-item links, quality scores), and (3) **allocation algorithms** distribute credits using weight policy and enricher evaluations. An admin finalizes the result. Statements are deterministic and recomputable from stored data. No server-held signing keys in V0.

| RECEIPT_APPEND_ONLY              | DB trigger rejects UPDATE/DELETE on `ingestion_receipts`. Once ingested, receipt records are immutable facts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| RECEIPT_IDEMPOTENT               | `ingestion_receipts.id` is deterministic from source data (e.g., `github:pr:owner/repo:42`). Re-ingestion of the same receipt is a no-op (PK conflict → skip).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| POOL_IMMUTABLE                   | DB trigger rejects UPDATE/DELETE on `epoch_pool_components`. Once recorded, a pool component's algorithm, inputs, and amount cannot be changed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| IDENTITY_BEST_EFFORT             | Ingestion receipts carry `platform_user_id` and optional `platform_login`. Resolution to `user_id` via `user_bindings` is best-effort. Unresolved receipts keep `user_id = NULL` in selection, but `epoch_receipt_claimants` rows preserve them as identity claimants (keyed by stable external identity) so attribution remains visible and can resolve later when bindings appear.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ADMIN_FINALIZES_ONCE             | An admin reviews recomputable user projections, optionally records per-subject review overrides, then triggers finalize. Finalization materializes canonical claimant-scoped final allocations before signing. Single action closes the epoch — no per-event approval workflow.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| APPROVERS_PER_SCOPE              | Each scope declares its own `approvers[]` list. At closeIngestion the current approver list and its hash are pinned on the epoch (APPROVERS_PINNED_AT_REVIEW). Finalization and sign-data check against the **pinned** set, not repo-spec. V0: single scope, single approver in repo-spec. Multi-scope: each `.cogni/projects/*.yaml` carries its own list. Addresses normalized to lowercase at storage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| SIGNATURE_SCOPE_BOUND            | Signed typed data must include `node_id + scope_id + epoch_id + final_allocation_set_hash + pool_total_credits`. Prevents cross-scope, cross-node, and cross-epoch signature replay.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| SIGNATURE_DEPLOYMENT_BOUND       | EIP-712 v2 includes wallet-visible `deploymentEnvironment`, derived only from the server's validated `DEPLOY_ENVIRONMENT` (`candidate-a`, `preview`, `production`; `local`/`test` are isolated development values). Sign-data and finalize fail closed when it is missing or unsupported. The v2 domain version makes legacy v1 signatures incompatible.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| EPOCH_THREE_PHASE                | Epochs progress through `open → review → finalized`. No backward transitions. `open`: ingest + select. `review`: ingestion closed, selection still allowed. `finalized`: immutable forever.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| INGESTION_CLOSED_ON_REVIEW       | App-level enforcement — `CollectEpochWorkflow` exits when `epoch.status != 'open'`. No DB trigger on `ingestion_receipts` (V0) because `ingestion_receipts` has no `epoch_id` column; epoch membership is determined at the selection layer. Raw facts locked once review begins; late arrivals rejected.

| SELECTION_AUTO_POPULATE          | Auto-population inserts selection rows for new receipts and updates `user_id` only on rows where it's NULL. Never overwrites the admin-owned fields (`weight_override_milli`, `note`). Delta processing: skip identity resolution for receipts already selected with a resolved `user_id`. (The policy-owned `included` flag is re-synced every pass — see SELECTION_INCLUDED_IDEMPOTENT.)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| SELECTION_INCLUDED_IDEMPOTENT    | `included` is **policy-owned**, not frozen at first insert. Every collect pass re-derives the selection policy's verdict for each in-window receipt and re-syncs the `included` flag on existing `epoch_selection` rows via a targeted `updateSelectionIncluded` — so a selection-policy change (or a `source_refs` edit) propagates to already-materialized receipts. Previously `materializeSelection` wrote `included` only on first insert (`ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`), so a policy change never reached existing rows, stranding receipts at stale `included = false` → zero contributors. Admin-owned `weight_override_milli` and `note` are preserved; only the policy-owned `included` is overwritten.                                                    |

| SCOPE_SCOPED                     | All epoch-level tables include `scope_id UUID NOT NULL`. `scope_id` identifies the governance/statement domain (project) within a node.

| SOURCE_NO_ADAPTER                | Coverage gaps are surfaced **loudly at bootstrap, never fatally at runtime**. `container.ts` cross-checks repo-spec `activity_sources` against registered adapters and logs `CONFIG_SOURCE_NO_ADAPTER` at error level for any configured source missing an adapter. At runtime, `resolveStreams` **skips a source with no poll adapter** (returns no streams, logs `attribution.poll_skipped_no_adapter` at warn) so the epoch proceeds to select webhook-deposited receipts. Reverts the #519 regression where the runtime throw killed `CollectEpoch` before selection — fatal even for legitimately webhook-only sources. `collectFromSource` keeps its `SOURCE_NO_ADAPTER` throw as a defensive guard (unreachable once `resolveStreams` yields no streams). |
| WEBHOOK_ONLY_SOURCE              | A source whose receipts arrive only via the webhook receiver (no worker poll adapter) is a first-class case, not a misconfig — **git** is the canonical example: the operator GitHub App webhook is the live ingest path and the scheduler-worker holds no GH App key by design. No special config needed: `resolveStreams` skips its absent poll plane and the webhook receipts flow through selection normally. Tradeoff: `POLL_RECONCILES_WEBHOOKS` does not hold for a webhook-only source until an operator-hosted reconcile poll lands (vNext); webhook misses are not yet backfilled.                                                                                                                                                                     |

Webhook misses caught on next poll cycle via deterministic event IDs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| WEBHOOK_VERIFY_VIA_OSS           | Signature verification uses platform OSS libraries (`@octokit/webhooks-methods` for GitHub), not bespoke crypto.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| WEBHOOK_SECRET_NOT_IN_CODE       | Webhook secrets sourced from environment variables (V0) or connections table (future), never hardcoded in source. Per `serverEnv.GH_WEBHOOK_SECRET`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| EVALUATION_UNIQUE_PER_REF_STATUS | `UNIQUE(epoch_id, evaluation_ref, status)` — one draft + one locked row per evaluation ref per epoch. Drafts overwritten via UPSERT; locked evaluations written once at `closeIngestionWithEvaluations`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| EVALUATION_FINAL_ATOMIC          | Locked evaluation writes + `evaluations_hash` computation + epoch `open→review` transition happen in a single DB transaction. No partial finalization. If any step fails, nothing commits.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| STATEMENT_FROM_FINAL_ONLY        | `computeReceiptWeights` for statement purposes MUST consume only `status='locked'` evaluations and `status='locked'` claimant records. Draft data is explicitly excluded from any binding computation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| CANONICAL_JSON                   | All payload and inputs hashing uses `canonicalJsonStringify()` — sorted keys at every depth, no whitespace, BigInt serialized as string. Defined once in `packages/attribution-ledger/src/hashing.ts`, used everywhere.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| INPUTS_HASH_COMPLETE             | Each enricher defines its own `inputs_hash` covering ALL meaningful dependencies consumed. Canonically serialized before hashing. If any input changes, `inputs_hash` changes, and the system knows the evaluation is stale.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| PAYLOAD_HASH_COVERS_CONTENT      | `payload_hash` = SHA-256 of `canonicalJsonStringify(payload)`. Stored in DB regardless of inline vs. object storage. `evaluations_hash` on the epoch uses `payload_hash`, never re-serializes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ENRICHER_SNAPSHOT_RULE           | Enrichers may do I/O (read files, call APIs), but anything learned from outside the attribution store MUST be snapshotted into the evaluation payload (or referenced by content-hash). If it's not in the evaluation, it doesn't exist for scoring. No live reads during allocation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| EVALUATION_REF_NAMESPACED        | Evaluation refs follow `org.type.version` format (e.g., `cogni.work_item_links.v0`, `cogni.echo.v0`). Regex: `/^[a-z][a-z0-9]*\.[a-z][a-z0-9_]*\.v\d+$/`.

| WEIGHT_PINNING                   | Weight config is set at epoch creation. Subsequent collection runs use the existing epoch's `weight_config`, not the input-derived config. Config drift logs a warning. `weight_config_hash` (SHA-256 of canonical JSON) is computed and locked at `closeIngestion` as the reproducibility anchor.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| CONFIG_LOCKED_AT_REVIEW          | At `closeIngestion` (open→review), the epoch's `weight_config_hash` and `allocation_algo_ref` are computed and locked.

## Project Scoping

The attribution ledger uses two orthogonal scoping keys:

- **`node_id`** (UUID) — Deployment identity. Identifies the running instance. One node = one database, one set of infrastructure, one `docker compose up`. Never overloaded for governance semantics. See [identity-model spec](./identity-model.md).
- **`scope_id`** (UUID) — Governance/statement domain. Identifies which **project** an epoch, its activity, and its statements belong to. Derived deterministically as `uuidv5(node_id, scope_key)` where `scope_key` is the human-readable slug (e.g., `'default'`). A project is a human-defined ownership boundary (e.g., "chat service", "shared infrastructure", "code review daemon") with its own DAO, weight policy, and payment rails.

**Terminology:** "Project" is the human concept. `scope_id` is the canonical database key. `scope_id` is not necessarily a filesystem path — path-based routing is one resolver strategy, but scopes can also be assigned by repository, by label, or by explicit declaration.

**V0 default:** All nodes start with a single scope: `scope_key = 'default'`, `scope_id = uuidv5(node_id, 'default')`. The scope UUID is declared in `repo-spec.yaml`. Multi-scope support activates when `.cogni/projects/*.yaml` manifests are added.

**Composite invariants:**

- `ONE_OPEN_EPOCH` → `UNIQUE(node_id, scope_id) WHERE status = 'open'`
- `EPOCH_WINDOW_UNIQUE` → `UNIQUE(node_id, scope_id, period_start, period_end)`
- Workflow IDs include scope: `ledger-collect-{scopeId}-{periodStart}-{periodEnd}`

**Scope resolution at ingestion:**

1. Activity event arrives (e.g., a merged PR touching `apps/chat/src/thread.ts`)
2. Resolver maps the event to a `scope_id` using project manifest rules (file path patterns, repository name, explicit labels)
3. If the resolved `scope_id` is not in the current manifest set, the event is **rejected** (not silently dropped, not assigned to default)
4. Events touching files in multiple scopes generate **one event per scope** (the same PR can attribute to multiple projects)

**Scope validation:** The `scope_id` on every `ingestion_receipts` row must reference a scope UUID declared in `.cogni/projects/*.yaml` (or match the node's `scope_id` from `repo-spec.yaml` for V0 default scope). This is enforced at the application layer during ingestion — not via FK constraint, since manifests are YAML files, not DB rows.

## Design

### System Architecture

**Next.js** handles authentication (SIWE), authorization (admin check), read queries (direct DB), and write request enqueuing (start Temporal workflow, return 202).

**Temporal worker** (`services/scheduler-worker/`) handles all write/compute actions: activity collection via source adapters, identity resolution, allocation computation, epoch finalization. All workflows are idempotent via deterministic workflow IDs. The worker imports pure domain logic from `@cogni/attribution-ledger` and DB operations from `@cogni/db-client`.

**`packages/attribution-ledger/`** contains pure domain logic shared between the app and the worker: model types, `computeStatementItems()`, `computeReceiptWeights()`, `explodeToClaimants()`, and error classes. `src/core/attribution/public.ts` re-exports from this package so app code uses `@/core/attribution`.

**Postgres** stores the append-only ingestion receipts with DB-trigger enforcement of immutability.

### Auth Model (V0 — Simplified)

SIWE wallet login provides `{ id, walletAddress }` in the session. Authorization is a per-scope wallet allowlist — no multi-role `ledger_issuers` table in V0.

**Approver configuration** follows the repo-spec pattern (committed to repo, no env override, same as `node_id` and `dao_contract`):

```yaml
# .cogni/repo-spec.yaml — V0 default scope
ledger:
  approvers:
    - "0xYourWalletAddress"
```

V0 has one scope (`default`), so `ledger.approvers` in repo-spec.yaml is the single source of truth. When multi-scope activates, each `.cogni/projects/*.yaml` carries its own `ledger.approvers[]` list, overriding the repo-spec default for that scope.

Loaded via `getLedgerConfig()` in `repoSpec.server.ts`, validated by Zod schema (array of EVM addresses), cached at startup.

Admin capability (wallet must be in scope's `approvers[]`) required for:

- Triggering activity collection (or let Temporal cron handle it)
- Editing review subject overrides
- Triggering epoch finalize
- Recording pool components
- Signing epoch statements (EIP-712 typed data, required before finalize)

Public read routes expose closed-epoch data only (epochs list, user projections, claimant attribution, statements). Ingestion receipts (PII fields: platformUserId, platformLogin, artifactUrl) require SIWE authentication. Open/current epoch data requires SIWE authentication.

### Pipeline Architecture — Three Plugin Surfaces

The attribution pipeline has three composable extension points. Each surface has a stable contract; new implementations slot in without touching core code.

**Surface 1 (Source Adapters)** is fully implemented. See [Source Adapter Interface](#source-adapter-interface).

**Surface 2 (Epoch Enrichers)** is the enrichment layer between "raw facts collected" and "allocation computed." Enrichers run as Temporal activities, consuming selected receipts via `getSelectedReceiptsWithMetadata()` and producing typed `EpochEvaluation` rows. Each enricher defines its own `evaluation_ref` (namespaced: `cogni.work_item_links.v0`), `algo_ref`, `inputs_hash` composition, and payload shape. The pipeline validates evaluation envelopes (ref format, hash format) but treats payloads as opaque — payload shape is per-plugin.

**Surface 3 (Allocation Algorithms)** dispatches by `algoRef`. V0: `weight-sum-v0` ignores evaluations. Future: `work-item-budget-v0` reads `cogni.work_item_links.v0` evaluations.

### Evaluation Lifecycle (Draft/Locked)

All three layers run continuously throughout an epoch:

- **Ingestion** — adapters collect events on each scheduled pass
- **Enrichment** — enrichers re-run on each pass, emitting `status='draft'` evaluations. Drafts power the UI (provisional work-item links, projected allocations). Drafts are overwritten on each pass (UPSERT by `epoch_id + evaluation_ref + status='draft'`).
- **Allocation** — can run against draft evaluations for UI projections (labeled provisional)

At **closeIngestion** (EVALUATION_FINAL_ATOMIC):

1. Enrichers run one final time against the complete selected receipt set
2. Locked evaluations written as NEW rows (`status='locked'`) alongside existing drafts
3. In a **single DB transaction**: insert locked evaluations + compute `artifacts_hash` + transition epoch `open→review`
4. After this point: locked evaluations are immutable (EVALUATION_LOCKED_IMMUTABLE). Writes to a non-open epoch are rejected.
5. Allocation runs against locked evaluations only for statement computation (STATEMENT_FROM_FINAL_ONLY)
6. Draft rows retained for audit/diff visibility

### Hashing Invariants

All evaluation hashing follows these non-negotiable rules:

- **`canonicalJsonStringify(value)`** — deterministic JSON: sorted keys at every depth, no whitespace, BigInt as string. Defined once in `packages/attribution-ledger/src/hashing.ts` (CANONICAL_JSON).
- **`inputs_hash`** — per-enricher composition covering ALL meaningful dependencies. If any input changes, the hash changes. Canonically serialized before SHA-256 (INPUTS_HASH_COMPLETE).
- **`payload_hash`** — `sha256OfCanonicalJson(payload)`. Stored in DB regardless of inline vs. object storage (PAYLOAD_HASH_COVERS_CONTENT).
- **`artifacts_hash`** — on `epochs` table. SHA-256 of sorted `(evaluation_ref, algo_ref, inputs_hash, payload_hash)` tuples from locked evaluations only. Computed by `computeArtifactsHash()`. Set atomically at `closeIngestionWithEvaluations` (EVALUATION_FINAL_ATOMIC).

### Activity Ingestion

Source adapters collect contribution activity from external systems and normalize it into `ingestion_receipts`. Each adapter:

1. **Connects** to one external system via official OSS client (`@octokit/graphql`, `discord.js`)
2. **Fetches** events since last cursor (or within the epoch time window)
3. **Normalizes** to `IngestionReceipt` with deterministic ID, provenance fields, and platform identity
4. **Inserts** idempotently (PK conflict = skip)

Identity resolution happens after ingestion: lookup `user_bindings` (from [decentralized-identity spec](./decentralized-user-identity.md)) to map `(source, platform_user_id)` → `user_id`. If no binding exists yet, the receipt still flows into `epoch_receipt_claimants` as an unresolved identity claimant keyed by stable external identity (`identity:provider:externalId`).

### Weight Policy

Credit allocation uses a simple per-event-type weight configuration stored as integer milli-units:

```jsonc
// Example weight_config (stored in epoch.weight_config JSONB)
{
  "github:pr_merged": 8000, // 8.000 units
  "github:review_submitted": 2000, // 2.000 units
  "github:issue_closed": 1000, // 1.000 units
  "discord:message_sent": 500, // 0.500 units
}
```

Per-receipt weight = `weightOverrideMilli ?? weightConfig[source:eventType] ?? 0`. Allocators compute per-receipt units (`ReceiptUnitWeight[]`), then `explodeToClaimants()` joins receipt weights with locked `epoch_receipt_claimants` to produce per-claimant allocations. The weight config is pinned per epoch (stored in the epoch row) for reproducibility. V0 derives weights from `activitySources` keys via `deriveWeightConfigV0()` — a pure, deterministic mapping (e.g., `github` → `github:pr_merged: 1000, github:review_submitted: 500, github:issue_closed: 300`). If an epoch already exists, its pinned config takes precedence over input-derived weights (WEIGHT_PINNING).

### Epoch Lifecycle

Epoch status models **governance finality**, not payment execution. Distribution state lives on `epoch_statements`.

```
1. OPEN          Temporal cron (weekly) or admin triggers collection
                 → Creates epoch with status='open', period_start/period_end + weight_config
                 → Runs source adapters → ingestion_receipts (raw facts)
                 → Resolves identities → updates user_id on selection rows
                 → Runs enrichers → epoch_evaluations (draft, overwritten each pass)
                 → Claimant resolution: `materializeSelection` inserts `epoch_receipt_claimants` (draft) per receipt
                 → Computes recomputable per-user rollups → epoch_user_projections
                 → Admin selects: adjust inclusion, resolve identities, record pool components

2. REVIEW        closeIngestionWithEvaluations locks config + evaluations (CONFIG_LOCKED_AT_REVIEW, EVALUATION_FINAL_ATOMIC)
                 → Enrichers run one final time → locked evaluations
                 → Sets allocation_algo_ref, weight_config_hash, evaluations_hash on epoch (immutable after)
                 → No new ingestion_receipts (INGESTION_CLOSED_ON_REVIEW)
                 → No new pool components (POOL_LOCKED_AT_REVIEW)
                 → Selection still mutable: adjust inclusion, weight overrides, identity resolution
                 → Admin reviews + records `epoch_review_subject_overrides` (absolute override values, not deltas)
                 → User projections recomputed on demand from selected receipts + locked evaluations + locked weight_config
                 → Read models resolve current display names and linked/unlinked state at read time

3. FINALIZED     Admin triggers finalize (requires signature + base_issuance)
                 → Loads locked `epoch_receipt_claimants` + selected receipts
                 → `computeReceiptWeights()` → per-receipt units
                 → `explodeToClaimants()` joins receipt weights × locked claimants → `FinalClaimantAllocation[]`
                 → Materializes `epoch_final_claimant_allocations` (canonical signed claimant units)
                 → Reads pool components → pool_total_credits
                 → computeAttributionStatementLines(final_claimant_allocations, pool_total) → epoch_statement
                 → Stores statement + signature atomically → epoch immutable forever
```

**Transitions:**

- `open → review`: Automatically at the start of the next epoch window (close-on-transition), **or** admin triggers early via API route. When a new window begins, `transitionEpochForWindow` closes the previous epoch and creates the new one atomically in a single DB transaction.
- `review → finalized`: Admin action. Requires 1-of-N EIP-712 signature from scope's `approvers[]` + at least one `base_issuance` pool component.
- No backward transitions. Corrections use `supersedes_statement_id` on a new epoch statement.

### Statement Computation

Finalization is claimant-aware. Claimant ownership lives in the `epoch_receipt_claimants` table (not in evaluations). Given locked claimant records, selected receipts, and a total pool:

1. Load locked `epoch_receipt_claimants` for the epoch (one row per receipt, each with `claimantKeys[]`)
2. Load selected receipts and compute per-receipt weights via `computeReceiptWeights(algoRef, receipts, weightConfig)`
3. Join receipt weights × locked claimants via `explodeToClaimants()` — splits units equally among claimant keys per receipt (largest-remainder rounding), groups by claimant key across all receipts
4. Persist canonical claimant-scoped unit rows in `epoch_final_claimant_allocations`
5. Compute each claimant's share: `final_units / total_units`
6. Distribute `pool_total_credits` proportionally using BIGINT arithmetic
7. Apply largest-remainder rounding to ensure exact sum equals pool total
8. Output statement lines shaped like `[{ claimant_key, claimant, final_units, pool_share, credit_amount, receipt_ids }]`

The final allocation set hash (SHA-256 of canonical claimant allocation data, sorted by claimant key) pins the exact finalized input set. Combined with `pool_total_credits`, locked evaluations, locked claimant records, and `weight_config`, the statement is fully deterministic and reproducible.

### Pool Model

Unchanged. Each epoch's credit budget is the sum of independently computed pool components:

- **`base_issuance`** — constant amount per epoch (bootstraps early-stage work)
- **`kpi_bonus_v0`** — computed from DAO-defined KPI snapshots with pinned algorithm
- **`top_up`** — explicit governance allocation with evidence link

Each component stores `algorithm_version`, `inputs_json`, `amount_credits`, and `evidence_ref`.

### Verification

`GET /api/v1/attribution/verify/epoch/:id` performs independent verification from **stored data only** (not re-fetching from GitHub/Discord, which may be private or non-deterministic):

1. Fetch all `ingestion_receipts` for the epoch
2. Recompute user projections from receipts + stored `weight_config`
3. Read locked `epoch_receipt_claimants` + `epoch_review_subject_overrides`
4. Recompute `computeReceiptWeights()` + `explodeToClaimants()` and compare against `epoch_final_claimant_allocations`
5. Recompute statement lines from final claimant allocations + pool components
6. Compare recomputed values against stored statement
7. Return verification report

Composite PK: `(node_id, receipt_id)`. No `scope_id` — receipts are scope-agnostic global facts (RECEIPT_SCOPE_AGNOSTIC). Scope assigned at selection layer via epoch membership. No `epoch_id` — epoch membership assigned at selection layer. No `user_id` — identity resolution lands in `epoch_selection.user_id` (truly immutable raw log). No `domain` column — `ingestion_receipts` is a **shared Layer 0 event archive**. Attribution, Treasury, Knowledge, and any future domain pipeline each select independently from this table. Domain membership is determined at each pipeline's selection layer, not at ingestion.

DB trigger rejects UPDATE/DELETE (RECEIPT_APPEND_ONLY).

Indexes: `(node_id, event_time)`, `(source, event_type)`, `(platform_user_id)`

Constraint: `UNIQUE(epoch_id, receipt_id)`

DB trigger rejects INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE when `epochs.status = 'finalized'` (SELECTION_FREEZE_ON_FINALIZE). Mutable during `open` and `review`, immutable after finalize. Reviewers can adjust inclusion, weight overrides, and identity resolution during review — these are auditable human decisions, not silent edits.

**Auto-population rules (SELECTION_AUTO_POPULATE):**

After each collection run, the `materializeSelection` activity creates selection rows for newly ingested receipts:

1. **Delta processing (identity)**: For identity resolution, only receipts without an existing selection row (or with `user_id IS NULL`) are processed. Receipts already selected with a resolved `user_id` keep their `user_id`. This preserves admin edits to `weight_override_milli` and `note`.
2. **Insert-or-update-userId-only**: New receipts get `INSERT` with resolved `user_id` (or NULL if unresolved) and the selection policy's `included` verdict. Existing rows with `user_id IS NULL` get only `user_id` updated (fills in newly-added bindings on re-run). Admin fields `weight_override_milli` and `note` are never touched by auto-population.
   2a. **Policy `included` re-sync (SELECTION_INCLUDED_IDEMPOTENT)**: Independently of the identity delta, every pass re-derives the selection policy verdict for each in-window receipt and writes the policy-owned `included` flag onto existing rows via `updateSelectionIncluded`. This makes a `source_refs` or policy change propagate to already-materialized receipts instead of stranding them at a stale verdict.
3. **Query by epochId**: The activity queries receipts by epoch membership (via the epoch's `period_start`/`period_end`), using `epochId` as the authoritative scope. The epoch row is loaded first; period dates serve as a guard assertion.
4. **Provider-scoped resolution**: Identity resolution queries `user_bindings` filtered by `provider` (e.g., `'github'`). No cross-provider resolution. The `platformUserId` stored in `ingestion_receipts` must match the `external_id` format in `user_bindings` (GitHub: numeric `databaseId` as string).

Constraints / indexes:

- Partial unique `(node_id, epoch_id, receipt_id) WHERE status = 'draft'` — one draft per receipt per epoch per tenant (upsert overwrites)
- Partial unique `(node_id, epoch_id, receipt_id) WHERE status = 'locked'` — exactly one locked snapshot per receipt
- `UNIQUE(node_id, epoch_id, receipt_id, inputs_hash)` — idempotency: same inputs → same row
- Index `(node_id, epoch_id, status)` — allocation reads: all locked rows for an epoch

**Lifecycle:** Draft claimant rows are inserted by `materializeSelection` (default-author resolver: `receiptId → claimantKey(author)`). Future enrichers that discover coauthors call `upsertDraftClaimants()` directly. At `closeIngestion`, `lockClaimantsForEpoch()` copies all draft rows to locked status. Locked rows are immutable — used at finalization by `explodeToClaimants()`.

**v0 claimants_json shape:** `["user:uuid-123"]` or `["identity:github:42"]` — array of claimant keys. Equal split assumed by `explodeToClaimants()`. No PPM in v0.

Post-signing corrections use amendment statements (`supersedes_statement_id`), never reopen-and-edit.

### `epoch_statement_signatures` — client-side EIP-712 signatures (schema only)

Constraints:

- `UNIQUE(epoch_id, evaluation_ref, status)` — one draft + one locked per ref per epoch (EVALUATION_UNIQUE_PER_REF_STATUS)
- `CHECK (status IN ('draft', 'locked'))` — only two valid states
- `CHECK (payload_json IS NOT NULL OR payload_ref IS NOT NULL)` — at least one payload source
- Index on `epoch_id` for lookups

**Row model:** Drafts are overwritten via UPSERT each collection pass. Locked evaluations are written once inside the `closeIngestionWithEvaluations` transaction (EVALUATION_FINAL_ATOMIC). Both draft and locked rows coexist — draft for audit/diff visibility, locked for statement computation.

**Payload sizing (V0):** All payloads inline (`payload_json`). `payload_ref` support stubbed for future large evaluations (> 256KB).

## Source Adapter Interface

Data sources declare capabilities via `DataSourceRegistration` — a composable manifest with optional `PollAdapter` (Temporal activity) and `WebhookNormalizer` (HTTP route → feature service). Both produce `ActivityEvent[]` and converge at `AttributionStore.insertIngestionReceipts()`.

```typescript
// Port definition (packages/ingestion-core/src/port.ts)

interface DataSourceRegistration {
  readonly source: string; // "github", "discord"
  readonly version: string; // bump on schema changes
  readonly poll?: PollAdapter; // Temporal activity calls this
  readonly webhook?: WebhookNormalizer; // Feature service calls this
}

interface PollAdapter {
  streams(): StreamDefinition[];
  collect(params: CollectParams): Promise<CollectResult>;
}

interface WebhookNormalizer {
  readonly supportedEvents: readonly string[];
  verify(
    headers: Record<string, string>,
    body: Buffer,
    secret: string
  ): Promise<boolean>;
  normalize(
    headers: Record<string, string>,
    body: unknown
  ): Promise<ActivityEvent[]>;
}
```

**Poll path** (Temporal worker): `CollectEpochWorkflow → registration.poll!.collect() → insertIngestionReceipts()`

**Webhook path** (feature service): `POST /api/internal/webhooks/:source → WebhookReceiverService → registration.webhook!.verify() → normalize() → insertIngestionReceipts()`

Both paths produce deterministic event IDs (`github:pr:owner/repo:42`), so duplicate delivery (webhook + poll) is a PK no-op (RECEIPT_IDEMPOTENT).

Poll adapters live in `services/scheduler-worker/src/adapters/ingestion/` and webhook normalizers in `src/adapters/server/ingestion/` (ADAPTERS_NOT_IN_CORE). They use official OSS clients: `@octokit/graphql` for GitHub poll, `@octokit/webhooks-methods` for GitHub webhook verification.

**Forward path:** Singer (MIT/Apache) taps will replace bespoke TypeScript adapters for new data sources. Contract: `tap → stdout JSON stream → map to IngestionReceipt`. Temporal orchestrates tap execution and persists Singer `state.json` to Postgres. V0 TypeScript adapters (GitHub) remain until Singer equivalents are proven. Both write to the same `ingestion_receipts` table — downstream pipelines don't know the difference. See [data-ingestion-pipelines spec](./data-ingestion-pipelines.md).

## Cross-Node & Multi-Source Architecture

> **Git is source #1 of N.** `ingestion_receipts` is a domain-agnostic Layer-0 archive (no `domain` column — Attribution, Treasury, and Knowledge each select from it independently). Adding a source = registering a `DataSourceRegistration` + extending `weight_config`; it is never a pipeline rewrite. The architecture below is source-shaped, not git-shaped.

**The ledger is per-node, not centralized.** Each node owns its own Postgres, its own epochs (`NODE_SCOPED`), its own `/gov/epoch`, and its own `approvers[]`. There is no global attribution database. The open question is only **where each source is _observed_ and how its receipts _reach_ the owning node's ledger** — and that answer differs per source:

| Source class                                                                        | Observed at                                                                                                                                                                        | Reaches the node's ledger via                                                                                                            |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Operator-mediated** (git)                                                         | **Operator only** — `cogni-operator` is the sole GitHub App across the org; no node has its own App. The operator webhook receiver sees PR/review/issue events for **every** repo. | Operator normalizes the event, resolves repo → owning `node_id` (catalog map), and delivers the `ActivityEvent` into that node's ledger. |
| **Node-local** (AI spend, on-chain, the node's own app events, that node's Discord) | **The node itself** — the signal is already inside the node's runtime/DB.                                                                                                          | The node's own `WebhookReceiverService` / poll adapter writes directly to its own `ingestion_receipts`. No operator hop.                 |

This is **federation, not centralization**: governance + epochs + UI stay per-node; only the _git source adapter_ is operator-hosted because git is the one signal a sovereign node physically cannot see for itself. External nodes (e.g. beacon) therefore have **no git epochs until the operator routes their repo's events to them** — an empty `/gov/epoch` on a fresh external node is expected, not a bug.

### Phasing

- **V0 (operator-only, current target).** Only the operator's own repo (`cogni-dao/standalone-node`) is configured; git is webhook-only (WEBHOOK_ONLY_SOURCE). Operator's webhook receipts are already deposited; the only fix needed is to stop `CollectEpoch` from crashing on the absent poll adapter (the #519 regression — `resolveStreams` now skips gracefully). This proves the entire ingest → select → enrich → allocate → finalize → statement loop for one node, one source.
- **vNext (node-template / multi-node).** Three additive seams, none of which touch the per-node ledger contract:
  1. **Repo → node routing** in the operator webhook normalizer (catalog already maps repo → `node_id`); tag each receipt with the owning node instead of always the operator's `node_id`.
  2. **Operator → node delivery**: operator POSTs the normalized `ActivityEvent` to the owning node's ingestion endpoint (reuses the existing `WebhookReceiverService` + `insertIngestionReceipts`, which `node-template` already ships). Operator is the org's git-event gateway; nodes stay sovereign for everything else.
  3. **Operator-hosted reconcile poll** (restores `POLL_RECONCILES_WEBHOOKS` for git without violating the no-GH-key-on-worker rule): the operator mints a short-lived per-repo token from its GitHub App and runs the poll itself. The scheduler-worker never holds the App key.
  4. **More sources** plug in as node-local `DataSourceRegistration`s on each node — the "many things" in attribution arrive here without any operator involvement.

### Operator attribution — regression-fix verification checklist (task.5066)

Definition of "working" for the V0 fix, in order. Each step is observable; do not claim done until the row is checked on a real env.

**Env reality:** candidate-a (`cogni-operator-test` / `cogni-test-org`) has its own git stream + DB; PROD (`cogni-operator` / `Cogni-DAO`) is where the real contribution stream is. Steps 2–4 are only meaningful on an env with live git activity. Residual caps (tracked separately, NOT this fix): `GH_WEBHOOK_SECRET` split-brain (bug.5000) drops ~half of deliveries; only the three weighted event types score.

### Public Read Routes (no auth, closed-epoch data only)

| Method | Route                                                    | Purpose                                           |
| ------ | -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| GET    | `/api/v1/public/attribution/epochs`                      | List closed epochs (paginated)                    |
| GET    | `/api/v1/public/attribution/epochs/:id/user-projections` | User projections for a closed epoch               |
| GET    | `/api/v1/public/attribution/epochs/:id/claimants`        | Finalized claimant attribution for a closed epoch |
| GET    | `/api/v1/public/attribution/epochs/:id/statement`        | Epoch statement (null if none, always 200)        |

### Authenticated Read Routes (SIWE session required)

| Method | Route                                         | Purpose                                                                                                           |
| ------ | --------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| GET    | `/api/v1/attribution/epochs`                  | List all epochs including open                                                                                    |
| GET    | `/api/v1/attribution/epochs/:id/activity`     | Ingestion receipts with PII + selection join                                                                      |
| GET    | `/api/v1/attribution/epochs/:id/contributors` | Epoch #, window, active policy, contributions grouped by identity (incl. unlinked identity-claimants at 0 points) |
| GET    | `/api/v1/attribution/verify/epoch/:id`        | Recompute statement from stored data + compare                                                                    |

These read routes accept a bearer token (agent-first surface), not only a SIWE browser session. An open-epoch contributor is visible by **GitHub identity** as soon as the selection policy selects its receipt — no linked Cogni user account is required. Unresolved identities appear as identity-claimants (`identity:github:<id>`), even at 0 points; linking to a user account matters only later, to **claim** distributions.

## Temporal Workflows

### CollectEpochWorkflow

The schedule adapter sends a `ScheduleActionPayload` wrapper; the workflow extracts `.input` immediately and treats it as `LedgerIngestRunV1`:

```typescript
interface LedgerIngestRunV1 {
  version: 1;
  scopeId: string;
  scopeKey: string;
  epochLengthDays: number;
  activitySources: Record<
    string,
    {
      creditEstimateAlgo: string;
      sourceRefs: string[]; // external namespaces (e.g., repo slugs)
      streams: string[]; // e.g., ["pull_requests", "reviews", "issues"]
    }
  >;
}
```

1. **Compute epoch window** — `computeEpochWindowV1()` (pure, deterministic) derives `periodStart`/`periodEnd` from `TemporalScheduledStartTime` + `epochLengthDays`. Monday-aligned UTC boundaries, anchored to 2026-01-05.
2. **Derive weight config** — `deriveWeightConfigV0()` maps `activitySources` keys to hardcoded V0 weights (e.g., `github:pr_merged: 1000`).
3. **Detect stale epoch** — `findStaleOpenEpoch({ periodStart, periodEnd })` checks if an open epoch exists for a different window than the current one.
4. **Ensure epoch (close-on-transition)** — Two paths:
   - If stale epoch found: `buildLockedEvaluations({ epochId })` computes evaluations + `artifactsHash`, then `transitionEpochForWindow` atomically closes the stale epoch (`open→review`) and creates the new epoch in a single DB transaction (locks claimants, inserts locked evaluations, pins config hashes, creates new epoch).
   - If no stale epoch: `ensureEpochForWindow` — find-or-create for the current window. Looks up by `(node_id, scope_id, period_start, period_end)` regardless of status. If found, returns as-is with pinned `weightConfig`. If not found, creates with input-derived weights. Weight config drift logs a warning; existing epoch's config wins (WEIGHT_PINNING).
5. **Skip if not open** — If epoch status is `review` or `finalized`, workflow exits immediately.
6. **Collect per source/sourceRef/stream** — Delegated to `CollectSourcesWorkflow` (child workflow). For each `activitySources` entry, for each `sourceRef`, for each `stream`:
   - Activity: load cursor from `ingestion_cursors`
   - Activity: `adapter.collect({ streams: [stream], cursor, window })` → receipts + `producerVersion`
   - Activity: insert `ingestion_receipts` (idempotent by PK, uses `adapter.version` as `producer_version`)
   - Activity: save cursor to `ingestion_cursors` (monotonic advancement)
7. **Select, resolve identities, and resolve claimants** — Delegated to `EnrichAndAllocateWorkflow` (child workflow). `materializeSelection` activity (SELECTION_AUTO_POPULATE):
   - Load epoch by ID → get period_start/period_end (guard assertion)
   - Query receipts in epoch window that are unselected (no selection row) or unresolved (selection.user_id IS NULL)
   - For each source: batch resolve `platformUserId` → `userId` via `user_bindings` (provider-scoped)
   - INSERT new selection rows (included=true, userId=resolved or NULL)
   - UPDATE existing unresolved rows: set userId only (never touch included/weight_override_milli/note)
   - **Claimant resolution**: for each selected receipt, insert draft `epoch_receipt_claimants` row via `upsertDraftClaimants()`. Default-author resolver: `claimantKey = user:{userId}` (resolved) or `identity:{source}:{platformUserId}` (unresolved). v0: single claimant per receipt, equal split.
8. **Enrich (draft)** — `evaluateEpochDraft` activity:
   - Load selected receipts with metadata via `getSelectedReceiptsWithMetadata(epochId)`
   - Run each registered enricher (e.g., echo enricher aggregates receipt counts)
   - Compute `inputsHash` and `payloadHash` per evaluation
   - `upsertDraftEvaluation()` — overwrites previous draft (EVALUATION_UNIQUE_PER_REF_STATUS)
9. **Compute allocations** — `computeAllocations` activity (unchanged, runs against selected receipts)
10. **Ensure pool components** — `ensurePoolComponents` activity (inline in parent workflow, conditional on `baseIssuanceCredits`)

Deterministic workflow ID: managed by Temporal Schedule (overlap=SKIP, run IDs per firing).

**Epoch window algorithm** (`computeEpochWindowV1`):

- Floor `asOf` timestamp to Monday 00:00 UTC
- Anchor: 2026-01-05 (first Monday of 2026)
- Period index = `floor((mondayMs - anchor) / epochMs)`
- `periodStart = anchor + periodIndex * epochMs`
- `periodEnd = periodStart + epochMs`

### FinalizeEpochWorkflow

Input: `{ epochId, signature }` — `signerAddress` derived from SIWE session (never client-supplied).

1. Verify epoch exists and is `review`
2. If epoch already `finalized`, return existing statement (EPOCH_FINALIZE_IDEMPOTENT)
3. Verify `allocation_algo_ref` and `weight_config_hash` are set (CONFIG_LOCKED_AT_REVIEW)
4. Verify at least one `base_issuance` pool component exists (POOL_REQUIRES_BASE)
5. Verify signer is in epoch's pinned `approvers[]` (APPROVERS_PINNED_AT_REVIEW / APPROVERS_PER_SCOPE)
6. Build canonical finalize message from epoch data, `ecrecover(message, signature)` — verify recovered address matches `signerAddress`
7. Load locked `epoch_receipt_claimants` + selected receipts for the epoch
8. `computeReceiptWeights(algoRef, receipts, weightConfig)` → per-receipt units
9. `explodeToClaimants(receiptWeights, lockedClaimants)` → `FinalClaimantAllocation[]` (fails loud if any receipt lacks locked claimants)
10. Persist `epoch_final_claimant_allocations` (canonical signed claimant units)
11. Read pool components, compute `pool_total_credits = SUM(amount_credits)`
12. `computeAttributionStatementLines(final_claimant_allocations, pool_total)` — BIGINT, largest-remainder
13. Compute claimant-aware `final_allocation_set_hash`
14. Atomic transaction: set `pool_total_credits` on epoch, update status to `'finalized'`, upsert final claimant allocations, insert epoch statement + statement signature
15. Return statement

Deterministic workflow ID: `ledger-finalize-{scopeId}-{epochId}`

## Signing Workflow

### EIP-712 v2 Typed Message

The wallet-visible signed message binds to node, scope, deployment environment,
and allocation data (SIGNATURE_SCOPE_BOUND, SIGNATURE_DEPLOYMENT_BOUND):

```
domain: { name: "Cogni Attribution", version: "2", chainId }
AttributionStatement: {
  nodeId,
  scopeId,
  epochId,
  deploymentEnvironment,
  finalAllocationSetHash,
  poolTotalCredits
}
```

`GET /sign-data` constructs the complete typed data server-side, including
`deploymentEnvironment` from validated runtime configuration. The frontend can
display and sign that value but cannot submit or override it. Finalize derives
the environment from the same server configuration and recomputes the exact v2
message before verification. `buildCanonicalMessage()` is retained only as a
deprecated EIP-191 compatibility helper; v1 EIP-712 signatures do not verify
against v2.

### Verification

Backend verifies the typed-data signature and checks:

1. Recovered address is in the epoch's pinned `approvers[]` (set at closeIngestion, not re-read from repo-spec)
2. Message fields match the epoch's actual data (prevents signing stale/wrong data)
3. `deploymentEnvironment` matches the finalizing server's validated runtime environment (prevents candidate-a/preview/production replay)

### Storage

Signatures are stored in `epoch_statement_signatures`. The `signer_wallet` is the recovered address, not client-supplied.

### Future Path

```
V0 (now):    Single EIP-712 sig passed at finalize time, 1-of-N from scope approvers
V1:          Separate /sign route for collecting signatures over time, multi-sig thresholds (close_epoch_threshold: 2)
V1:          Role separation (selection_admins vs statement_approvers)
V1:          Post sig hash to IPFS/Arweave → content hash on-chain
V2:          On-chain attestation registry (smart contract accepts epoch_hash + sig)
V3:          DAO multisig (Safe) — N-of-M signers required
```

## V1+ Deferred Features

The following are explicitly deferred from V0 and will be designed when needed:

- **Separate `/sign` route** (`POST /epochs/:id/sign`) — V1: collect signatures independently before finalize, needed for multi-approver quorum
- **Multi-sig thresholds** (`close_epoch_threshold: N`) — V1: require N-of-M approver signatures
- **Role separation** (`selection_admins` vs `statement_approvers`) — V1: separate who selects from who signs
- **`ledger_issuers` role system** (can_issue, can_approve, can_close_epoch) — V1: multi-role authorization
- **Per-receipt wallet signing** (EIP-712 or attestation-compatible equivalent) — V1: receipts as signed attestations
- **Receipt approval lifecycle** (proposed → approved → revoked, LATEST_EVENT_WINS) — V1: per-receipt workflows
- **On-chain attestation** — V0 verifies by recomputing from stored data; V1+ adds on-chain signature registry
- **Merkle trees / inclusion proofs** — V1+
- **Settlement distribution state machine** (`epoch_statements.status`: draft → signed → submitted → settled/failed) — V1+
- **UI pages** — V1+
- **DID/VC alignment** — V2+
- ~~**Automated webhook fast-path**~~ — Implemented via `WebhookNormalizer` port + `GitHubWebhookNormalizer`. See [Source Adapter Interface](#source-adapter-interface).
- **Formal `EpochEnricher` port** — V1: full executor dispatch via `resolveProfile()` + `dispatchAllocator()`. V0 calls enricher activities directly; plugin contracts scaffolded but executor not yet wired through them.
- **Object storage for large evaluations** (`payload_ref`) — V1: when an evaluation exceeds 256KB inline threshold. V0: all payloads inline.
- **AI quality scoring enricher** (`cogni.ai_scores.v0`) — future enricher, same `epoch_evaluations` table, different `evaluation_ref`

## Goal

Enable transparent, verifiable credit distribution where contribution activity is automatically collected, enriched with domain-specific context (work-item links, quality signals), valued via pluggable allocation algorithms, and finalized by an admin. Anyone can recompute the statement from stored data.

### Actor Migration Path (Planned)

Finalized statements now preserve claimant identity explicitly (`claimant_key`, `claimant`) and treat `epoch_allocations.user_id` as the resolved-human override surface, not the only economic subject. `actor_id` is still the migration target: when the `actors` table ships ([proj.operator-plane](../../work/projects/proj.operator-plane.md) v1), claimant keys can resolve to actor-backed subjects without changing the deterministic statement model. For human actors (`kind=user`), `actor_id` bridges 1:1 to `user_id` via the actors table. For agent actors, `actor_id` enables new attribution paths (gateway usage → agent → rewards). Every economic event remains scoped by `(node_id, scope_id)` — `actor_id` is locally unique per node, not a global identity. No invariant changes — PAYOUT_DETERMINISTIC and ALL_MATH_BIGINT apply regardless of subject key. See [identity-model.md](./identity-model.md).

### AI Agent Developer Actors (V0 Addendum)

External AI agents can request developer flight control for a specific node
before they are payout actors. The approval fact lives in RBAC, not in the
attribution ledger:

- Registration mints a `user_id` and bearer token for the AI agent.
- The node creator/admin approves or rejects the agent for one `node:{node_id}`
  through `POST /api/v1/nodes/{node_id}/developers`.
- Approval writes the OpenFGA `developer` tuple. `can_flight` is computed by the authorization model.
- `POST /api/v1/vcs/flight` checks `node.flight` before dispatching candidate-a.

No attribution statement changes when an agent receives flight permission. If
the agent later produces contribution activity, that activity enters the ledger
like any other claimant: unresolved first, then resolved to a human `user_id` or
future `actor_id` when bindings exist. Flight authority is operational control;
credit attribution remains governed by `(node_id, scope_id)` epoch rules.

## Non-Goals

- Algorithmic valuation (automated scoring) — weights are transparent, admin adjustable
- Server-held signing keys
- Full RBAC system (V0 uses per-scope approver allowlist)
- Real-time streaming (poll-based collection sufficient for weekly epochs)
- Formal enricher registration/plugin framework (V0 calls enricher activities directly; plugin contracts scaffolded in `@cogni/attribution-pipeline-contracts`)
- Payload shape standardization across enrichers (pipeline validates envelope only; payload is per-plugin, opaque)

## Accounting Boundary

A finalized attribution statement is **governance truth** (who earned what share), NOT a financial event. No money moves when an epoch is signed. Financial events occur only when funds move on-chain:

1. **Treasury funds MerkleDistributor** — Dr Liability:UnclaimedRewards / Cr Assets:Treasury:USDC
2. **User claims on-chain** — liability reduction via distributor claim

Optional accrual at epoch sign (Dr Expense:ContributorRewards / Cr Liability:UnclaimedRewards) is permitted but not required. See [financial-ledger spec](./financial-ledger.md) for the treasury pipeline.
