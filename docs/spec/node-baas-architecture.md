# Node Backend-as-a-Service Architecture

## Context

The [Node CI/CD Contract](./node-ci-cd-contract.md) defines how a submodule node is born, built, pinned, flighted, and promoted. This spec defines the adjacent product shape: what a node repository should look like once `node-template` is a proper **node-at-repo-root** repo.

The useful analogy is Supabase's backend-as-a-service model. A Supabase project centers on Postgres, then exposes integrated services around it: Auth, generated API, Realtime, Storage, Functions, pooler, dashboard, and CLI. Their architecture principle is that tools work in isolation but integrate through APIs and webhooks; their local CLI starts a full local stack rather than only app code. See [Supabase architecture](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/getting-started/architecture) and [Supabase local development](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/local-development).

Cogni should apply the same product idea to AI nodes: a node is not just a Next.js app. It is an app plus managed operational data, versioned knowledge, graph execution, identity, streams, secrets, and deployment declarations. The operator manages substrate provisioning; the node owns code and declarations.

## Goal

Define the stable node repo shape that makes a freshly minted node:

- usable as a standalone developer project;
- inspectable as a small product, not a copied monorepo fragment;
- able to build and push its own image;
- able to declare database, knowledge, graph, secret, and service shape without editing the operator plane;
- compatible with operator-hosted deployment through submodule pinning.

## Non-Goals

- CI/CD workflow details; see [Node CI/CD Contract](./node-ci-cd-contract.md).
- Operator provisioning internals: catalog rendering, AppSets, Caddy routes, OpenBao bootstrap, Argo, DNS.
- A Supabase clone. Cogni should reuse the BaaS mental model, not its exact service list or implementation choices.
- Pre-scaffolding every possible package for every node. Empty packages are tax unless the template needs them on day one.

## Core Model

A node has two sides:

| Side                  | Owner          | Examples                                                                                                                 |
| --------------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Node product**      | node repo      | `app/`, `packages/`, `k8s/base/`, `.cogni/rules/`, schema declarations, graph definitions                                |
| **Managed substrate** | operator plane | per-env DB provisioning, OpenBao values, ESO manifests, overlays, AppSets, gateway routes, candidate/preview/prod flight |

The node declares **shape**. The operator provisions and connects that shape per environment.

This is the same split already used for submodule nodes: the node repo owns app, packages, base manifests, local policy, and image build; the operator owns catalog, overlays, AppSets, provisioning, flight, and promotion.

### Spawn activity authority — generation 1

Every merged `type: node` catalog row projects three environment-sensitive facts into each
environment's local operator registry: the non-empty `deploy_envs` set, one `activity_env`, and the
stable owner wallet (resolved to that environment's own user row). A deployment is allowed to serve a
node without owning its activity ledger. Epoch schedules are created only when both conditions hold:

1. the local `DEPLOY_ENVIRONMENT` is present in `deploy_envs`; and
2. it exactly equals `activity_env`.

The v1 spawn protocol is deliberately fixed: a fresh wizard node is born with
`deploy_envs=[candidate-a]` and `activity_env=candidate-a`. This is **authority generation 1**, a
non-transferable initial state—not a claim that a catalog edit can atomically move authority. Preview
or production may later be added as passive deployments, but the env-management route rejects removal
of the final deployment and rejects removal of the current activity environment.

There is no production activity-authority cutover in v1. A future cutover must first specify a durable,
monotonic generation/fencing token and a two-phase `old authority quiesced → new authority active`
protocol that recovers across partial git/DB/Temporal failure. Until that lands, manually changing
`activity_env` is unsupported. Cross-environment webhook relay is a separate transport concern and is
not part of this registry projection slice.

### A node is a bundle, not a service — `node → services → deployments`

A **node is a codebase bundle**, not a single deployable. One node repo can build
**many independently-deployable units** — the Next.js `app/`, a Temporal worker under
`services/`, a migrator, future co-services — each with its **own image, its own
health, and its own scaling**. Calling a node "a service" (or assuming it _is_ the
Next.js app) is a category error: the app is one unit the node produces.

```text
Node              codebase bundle · identity = repo-spec node_id
  └─ 1:N  Service / deployable unit   app · worker · migrator · …   (own build + scaling)
        └─ 1:N  Deployment = (node, service, env) cell              the thing that runs, per env
```

**The deployment unit is `(node, service, env)`, not `(node, env)`.** A node's worker
can run 5 replicas in production while its app runs 1 — same node identity, different
services, independent scaling. `node_id` is the join key (identity · UI · RBAC ·
catalog projection); each **service** of that node is what actually deploys and scales.

> **Today's reality + the gap.** Most nodes ship only the `app/` unit; recurring work
> runs on the **shared** generic worker (RecurringWorkPort, below), so a node rarely
> needs its own service yet. A node that needs a **custom, independently-scaled
> service** (its own worker process, not the shared one) is the escape hatch — it
> declares the unit in **its own** `services/` and the operator wires per-(node,
> service, env) deploy + scale. That per-node-service deploy/scale wiring is **not
> first-class yet** (the catalog models one deployable per row); it is the forward
> work this `node → services → deployments` model names.

### Node-controlled surfaces

A sovereign node must be able to change these without an operator code PR:

| Surface          | Node-owned artifact                                            | Operator reaction                                                                                                  |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Operational data | `packages/postgres` schema and migrations                      | provision/apply the node's Postgres migration against that node's DB                                               |
| Knowledge data   | `packages/doltgres` schema and migrations                      | provision/apply the node's Doltgres migration, then commit DDL into Dolt history                                   |
| Graph behavior   | `packages/graphs` catalog and definitions                      | route execution to the node image and observe runs                                                                 |
| API/tool surface | node-local `packages/contracts` or `app/src/contracts`         | expose only through the node app image unless promoted to shared contracts                                         |
| Secrets          | `.cogni/secrets-catalog.yaml` key declarations                 | create OpenBao paths, ESO manifests, and per-env values                                                            |
| Storage          | `.cogni/node.yaml` bucket/object declarations                  | provision object store credentials and lifecycle policy                                                            |
| Streams          | `.cogni/node.yaml` stream declarations and event contracts     | provision Redis/SSE/WebSocket substrate when enabled                                                               |
| Recurring work   | a Temporal **client** + ops **route(s)** (`RecurringWorkPort`) | provision per-node queue + namespace-scoped Temporal creds; run generic workflows on the shared worker (see below) |
| Runtime shape    | `k8s/base`, health endpoints, ports                            | render overlays, AppSets, gateway routes                                                                           |

The operator may reject invalid declarations, but it should not require a root package or infra code edit for routine node evolution.

### Node→Temporal seam (recurring work)

Recurring work is a node-controlled surface, fully specified elsewhere — the row above
is the summary. The **substrate model** (one shared generic worker, per-node queues, and
**node-direct** schedule creation with the operator out of the create path; a per-node
worker only as an opt-in sovereign escape hatch) is in
[Temporal Substrate](./substrate-temporal.md). The **execution model**
(`NodeTaskWorkflow` / `GraphRunWorkflow`, grant↔node binding, the per-node dispatch
principal, decommission teardown) is in
[Temporal Patterns § Node-as-tenant](./temporal-patterns.md).

## Node-at-Repo-Root Layout

Target layout:

```text
.
├── app/
├── packages/
│   ├── graphs/
│   ├── postgres/
│   ├── doltgres/
│   ├── contracts/
│   └── domain/
├── k8s/
│   └── base/
├── .cogni/
│   ├── repo-spec.yaml
│   ├── node.yaml
│   ├── rules/
│   └── secrets-catalog.yaml
├── .github/
│   └── workflows/
├── pnpm-workspace.yaml
├── package.json
├── tsconfig.json
├── biome.json
└── Dockerfile
```

This is the node-repo view. In the operator monorepo, the same repo appears only as a gitlink at `nodes/<slug>` plus operator-owned catalog/overlay/appset rows.

### `app/`

The runtime application. Today this is the Next.js node app. It owns framework glue, request handlers, UI, bootstrap composition, env assertion, and runtime adapter wiring.

`app/` may import node-owned packages and cross-node baseline packages. Packages must not import `app/`.

### `packages/graphs`

Node-owned graph catalog and graph definitions.

This should be a package when graphs are reusable definitions imported by `app/`, tests, or future workers. If a graph process has lifecycle, the lifecycle entrypoint belongs in `services/`; the graph definitions still belong here.

Current state: the monorepo already has `nodes/<node>/graphs`. For node-at-root, prefer `packages/graphs` unless there is a concrete lifecycle reason to keep a top-level `graphs/` workspace.

### `packages/postgres`

Node-owned operational database package. Suggested package name: `@cogni/<node>-postgres`.

Responsibilities:

- node-local Drizzle schema slices for operational tables;
- inferred row types and public schema exports;
- typed client factory helpers that are schema-coupled but do not load env;
- optional pure adapters that take a DB client as constructor input.

Non-responsibilities:

- runtime env loading;
- root/superuser provisioning;
- per-env DSN construction;
- migrations execution lifecycle.

Those stay in `app/`, CLI scripts, or the operator plane.

Why `postgres` instead of `postgresdbclient+schema`: schema and typed client are coupled enough to live together, but the folder name should stay short and product-readable. The package contents can expose subpaths like `./schema`, `./client`, and `./adapters`.

Do not create this package until the node has node-local operational tables. Core tables shared by every node stay in the cross-node `@cogni/db-schema` / `@cogni/db-client` layer.

### `packages/doltgres`

Node-owned knowledge database package. Suggested package name: `@cogni/<node>-doltgres`.

Responsibilities:

- Doltgres-only Drizzle schema slices;
- inferred row types;
- typed knowledge adapter/client helpers;
- Dolt-specific helpers for commit, log, and diff when they are pure and reusable.

Non-responsibilities:

- operational tables;
- Postgres migrations;
- env loading;
- branch/merge workflow daemons.

The [database-expert skill](../../.claude/skills/database-expert/SKILL.md) and [Knowledge Data Plane](./knowledge-data-plane.md) remain authoritative on the Postgres-vs-Doltgres split: Postgres is hot operational data; Doltgres is AI-written or AI-refined knowledge with useful version history.

The package should avoid table sprawl. Default to generic knowledge rows with `domain` and `tags`; add companion tables only for true entities with distinct columns.

### `packages/contracts`

Optional node-specific API, tool, and event contracts.

Use this when a node has contracts that should be imported by `app/`, graphs, tests, or external node clients but are not universal enough for root `@cogni/node-contracts`.

### `packages/domain`

Optional node-specific pure domain logic.

Use this for policy, scoring, math, and typed domain objects that are not framework-bound and are not cross-node. Do not use it as a dumping ground for feature code.

### `k8s/base`

Node-owned deploy shape only: Deployment/Service shape, ports, health endpoints, and any node-local base manifest that describes what the app is.

Per-env overlays, AppSets, gateway routes, catalog rows, secret values, DNS, and environment ownership stay in the operator plane.

### `.cogni/`

Node control metadata:

- `repo-spec.yaml`: node identity and on-chain bindings;
- `node.yaml`: declared capabilities and substrate requirements;
- `rules/`: review rules and node-local policy;
- `secrets-catalog.yaml`: secret key shape only, never values.

A minted node must be born-reviewable: `.cogni/rules/` ships in the node repo before the first PR against that repo.

## BaaS Substrate Map

Cogni's BaaS surface should be small, composable, and portable:

| Cogni substrate      | Node declares                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Operator provides                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

The invariant is: **node declares shape; operator wires environment**.

## Cognition Substrate

Supabase delivers Auth, Storage, and a generated API as managed services. The same product idea applies to an agent's **working cognition**: an agent should not have to git-sync a tree of `AGENTS.md` files to learn how to operate a node. The node is the subject-matter expert for its niche ([`knowledge-syntropy-expert`](../../.claude/skills/knowledge-syntropy-expert/SKILL.md)); its knowledge hub is the codified mind. So the operator serves that mind as a substrate, fetched at session start.

**Endpoint.** `GET /api/v1/cognition` returns a node's kickstart bundle, advertised under `cognition` + `endpoints.knowledgeBootstrap` in `/.well-known/agent.json`. The bundle has five parts:

| Part               | Source                                                                     | Owner         |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| Mission            | `intent.mission` in the node's `.cogni/repo-spec.yaml`                     | repo-spec     |
| Orientation (full) | the `<slug>-agent-orientation` hub entry, rendered IN FULL                 | knowledge hub |
| Tooling invariants | `SESSION_BOOTSTRAP_INVARIANTS` constant in the node app                    | code          |
| Skills index       | hub entries of type `skill`/`guide`/`playbook` (use-when framed titles)    | knowledge hub |
| Domain pointers    | `listDomainsFull()` — registered domains + entry counts (empty suppressed) | knowledge hub |

The bundle's stance is **constitution + map**: the code-owned invariants say how every agent must behave; the repo-spec mission says why this node exists; the orientation entry is the current-node map an agent needs to start (where to edit, what not to run, what can break prod/candidate, what to recall next). The git skeleton is deliberately **minimal** — invariants + section frame + recall pointers — and the substance is the Dolt orientation entry, rendered **IN FULL** so the bootstrap _is_ the operating map (no second recall to be useful). Everything else (skills, domains) stays **index-first**: pointers only, never full bodies. The invariants are kept as terse axioms (not paragraphs), and the bundle surfaces the node's derived candidate host (`operator` → `test.cognidao.org`, else `<slug>-test.cognidao.org`) so "validate on candidate" names a concrete URL instead of an env agents must guess.

The response carries a fully-rendered `markdown` field that a **SessionStart hook** echoes to stdout; both Claude Code and Codex inject SessionStart stdout into the model's context, so one operator endpoint feeds both runtimes identically. The hook is wired once per runtime and calls a single shared loader (`scripts/agent/session-cognition.sh`): Claude Code via `.claude/settings.json`, Codex via `.codex/config.toml` (identical `hooks.SessionStart` → `type:"command"` shape). The loader derives the node's production cognition URL from `.cogni/repo-spec.yaml` `intent.name` (`operator`/`cogni-template` → `https://cognidao.org/api/v1/cognition`, every other slug → `https://<slug>.cognidao.org/api/v1/cognition`) and falls back to operator if a node hub is not live yet. The mechanism is symmetric; the one asymmetry is trust — Codex runs a repo-committed `.codex/` hook only after a one-time approval (`/hooks`), whereas this repo's `.claude` hooks are already trusted. Runtimes without a session hook self-serve the same repo-spec-derived URL.

**The v0 ownership split is deliberate.** The _irreducible_ invariants are code-owned because they must render even when the hub is empty or unreachable — a session must always bootstrap. Everything _expandable_ (skills, guides, growing domain expertise) is hub-delivered and refined in place via the contribution flow, never by editing this file. As the merge-to-`main` knowledge flow is exercised, the invariants can migrate into a hub `rule` entry; until then they stay code-owned so the substrate has no chicken-and-egg.

**Node identity: mission seed + agent-orientation entry.** Two artifacts give an agent its bearings, split by mutability:

- **`intent.mission`** in `.cogni/repo-spec.yaml` is the _stable_ one-line north star — why this node exists. It is surfaced as the bundle subtitle. Node formation seeds a refine-me starter (`renderRepoSpec`) so every new node ships with one; the launch agent narrows it.
- **`<slug>-agent-orientation`** (e.g. `operator-agent-orientation`) is the _mutable_ operating map in the knowledge hub — one `guide` entry per node, the current-node context for **every** kind of agent working here (coding, launch, research, governance, validation, operations), not only dev. It answers: what this node is, what agents do here, where authority lives, what actions are safe, what workflows exist, where to edit, what not to run, what can break prod/candidate, and what to recall next. It is a **composite** that cites deeper specs/skills rather than restating them, and cites `cognition-substrate-bootstrap` so the orientation pattern itself compounds in the DAG.

Every node maintains exactly one living orientation entry; agents **refine it in place** (REFINE_OVER_EXTEND) whenever repo layout, scripts, CI, deploy, auth, or validation behavior changes — it is the living map, not a one-time doc. The bundle renders this entry **in full**, preferring the node-specific `<name>-agent-orientation` over the generic starter. Because full-render makes the entry's length the bundle's cost, keep the orientation entry tight and composite (cite deeper specs/skills, don't restate them).

**Propagation.** A new node's knowledge hub is created empty (Doltgres data is not copied by forking the repo), so the orientation block ships as a seed: `@cogni/knowledge-base` base seeds carry a generic `cogni-agent-orientation` starter (`entryType: guide`) inherited by every node at `seed-doltgres` time, including `Cogni-DAO/node-template` and its forks (each carries its own `knowledge-base` copy; the seed is ported repo-by-repo since operator seeds do not auto-propagate). Each node then writes its node-owned, durable map as the sibling `<slug>-agent-orientation` (a re-seed may overwrite the shared starter, so refinement lives in the slug-specific entry). operator's own `operator-agent-orientation` cites `cognition-substrate-bootstrap` so the pattern compounds in the DAG.

**Boundaries.** The bundle is **authed** — any principal (cookie-session human OR `cogni_ag_sk_v1_` agent bearer) gets skill/domain pointers (title, use-when, recall path) plus the current-node orientation entry rendered in full; other entry bodies stay behind the read routes. It sits behind the same gate as the read routes (`KNOWLEDGE_READ_REQUIRES_PRINCIPAL`), so the index does not diverge from the read surface; `GET /api/v1/agent/register` stays the one public bootstrap seam (register → key → cognition). Local/Conductor sessions persist that key in `.env.cogni`; the SessionStart loader reads `.env.cogni` itself and passes `COGNI_API_KEY` (or the current production `COGNI_API_KEY_PROD` during the transition) as the bearer. Root `AGENTS.md` drops to a thin bootstrap pointer at the bundle; node-scoped and subdir `AGENTS.md` files remain (closest-file-wins still holds for code-local rules). This is reversible: revert the PR and `AGENTS.md` carries the full orientation again.

## Current State

In the monorepo today:

- root `packages/*` are cross-node/operator-owned packages;
- `pnpm-workspace.yaml` includes only legacy in-tree node workspaces; submodule-pinned nodes are not parent workspaces;
- `Cogni-DAO/node-template` is the canonical node-at-root template source;
- the operator monorepo may carry `nodes/node-template` only as a gitlink pin for deployment approval;
- `nodes/operator/packages/doltgres-schema` and any remaining legacy in-tree node-local packages are migration surfaces;
- node-template owns its graph and node-local packages in its external repo;
- the active submodule design expects a node-at-root template with `app/`, `graphs/`, `k8s/`, `packages/`, own CI, and own policy.

The proposed product shape is therefore not a greenfield rewrite. It is a naming and ownership cleanup around patterns already present.

### Current package audit

A 2026-06-05 package import audit found that most root packages are genuine shared substrate:

- app-wide platform packages are imported by operator, node-template, and remaining hosted node artifacts: `@cogni/ai-core`, `@cogni/ai-tools`, `@cogni/db-client`, `@cogni/db-schema`, `@cogni/ids`, `@cogni/node-contracts`, `@cogni/node-core`, `@cogni/node-shared`, `@cogni/node-streams`, `@cogni/node-ui-kit`, `@cogni/scheduler-core`, `@cogni/work-items`;
- graph substrate is shared: `@cogni/langgraph-graphs`, `@cogni/graph-execution-core`, `@cogni/graph-execution-host`;
- knowledge substrate is shared: `@cogni/knowledge-base` is imported by node-local Doltgres schema packages, and `@cogni/knowledge-store` is imported by apps and Doltgres packages;
- some root packages are operator-plane utilities rather than node-product packages: `@cogni/dns-ops`, `@cogni/temporal-workflows`, attribution pipeline packages.

So the first migration should not be a broad carve-out from root `packages/`. Moving shared substrate into a node would make the template look cleaner but would damage the current dependency truth.

## Playbook

Use this playbook when deciding whether to move or create a package.

### Step 1 - Classify the package

| Question                                                                  | Destination                                                                     |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Imported by two or more node apps/graphs/packages?                        | root `packages/<name>`                                                          |
| Imported only by one node repo's `app`, `packages`, or graph definitions? | node repo `packages/<name>`                                                     |
| Imported only by operator-plane code or root services?                    | root `packages/<name>` unless it is strictly `nodes/operator/app` product logic |
| Has process lifecycle, health checks, env loading, or worker loop?        | `services/<name>` or `app/`, not `packages/`                                    |
| Is a DB schema package with node-local tables?                            | node repo `packages/postgres` or `packages/doltgres`                            |

### Step 2 - Check real consumers

Run both package-declaration and import checks. Stale `package.json` dependencies are common enough that declarations alone are not authoritative.

```bash
rg -n '"@cogni/<name>"|from "@cogni/<name>"|from "@cogni/<name>/' \
  nodes packages services tests scripts \
  -g 'package.json' -g '*.{ts,tsx,js,mjs}'
```

Then classify only code importers under:

```text
nodes/<node>/app
nodes/<node>/graphs
nodes/<node>/packages/*
```

as node-product consumers. Root `packages`, `services`, `scripts`, CI, and operator provisioning are operator-plane or shared-substrate consumers.

### Step 3 - Move one package at a time

For a node-owned package move:

1. move the directory into `packages/<bare-name>` in the node-at-root repo, or `nodes/<node>/packages/<bare-name>` in the monorepo;
2. rename the package to `@cogni/<node>-<bare-name>`;
3. update import names and package declarations;
4. update `tsconfig` project references and package build validation;
5. run `pnpm packages:build` plus the package's targeted typecheck/tests;
6. avoid compatibility shims unless an actual external consumer is blocked.

For node-template projection work, prefer changing the projected node-at-root repo first. Inline monorepo nodes can keep their old shape until the projection proves the model.

## Pareto Package Priority

The highest-value moves, based on the current package layout, are:

| Priority | Move                                                                                                                       | Why                                                                                                                               |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

Packages that should **not** move in the MVP: `@cogni/db-client`, `@cogni/db-schema`, `@cogni/knowledge-base`, `@cogni/knowledge-store`, `@cogni/langgraph-graphs`, `@cogni/graph-execution-core`, `@cogni/graph-execution-host`, `@cogni/node-contracts`, `@cogni/node-core`, `@cogni/node-shared`, `@cogni/node-ui-kit`. They are shared substrate today.

## MVP

The MVP should not reorganize every package. It should make newly minted node repos feel coherent while preserving current deployment progress.

### M0 - Document and freeze the product shape

Land this spec and link it from the CI/CD contract. Treat it as the target shape for future node-at-root work.

No code moves.

### M1 - Normalize the node-at-root template package layout

In the node-template repo projection, prefer:

```text
packages/graphs
packages/doltgres
```

over:

```text
graphs
packages/doltgres-schema
```

Only do this in the node-at-root template lane, not as a drive-by across inline monorepo nodes. The monorepo can keep `nodes/<node>/graphs` temporarily because the CI/CD contract already names `graphs/` as carried content.

Acceptance:

- the generated node repo has a simple `packages/*` library layer;
- app imports use workspace names;
- local `pnpm packages:build` or equivalent builds the graph and Doltgres package;
- no operator build target treats the node package as root operator content.

### M2 - Rename Doltgres package by capability, not implementation detail

Move from `doltgres-schema` to `doltgres` in the node-at-root template.

Keep exports explicit:

```text
@cogni/<node>-doltgres
@cogni/<node>-doltgres/knowledge
@cogni/<node>-doltgres/work-items
```

If the migration blast radius is high, keep `doltgres-schema` in inline nodes and make the new name part of the projected template only. Do not add a compatibility shim unless a real consumer requires it.

### M3 - Add `packages/postgres` only when the template has a local table

Do not scaffold an empty Postgres package. The current database contract says node-local Postgres schema packages are created on first node-local table.

When needed, use:

```text
packages/postgres
```

with exports:

```text
@cogni/<node>-postgres
@cogni/<node>-postgres/schema
@cogni/<node>-postgres/client
```

The package must not read env. Runtime code passes DSNs or DB clients from `app/`.

### M4 - Add one node manifest for substrate declarations

Introduce `.cogni/node.yaml` as the node's compact substrate declaration:

```yaml
postgres:
  enabled: true
doltgres:
  enabled: true
graphs:
  package: "@cogni/<node>-graphs"
storage:
  enabled: false
streams:
  enabled: false
```

This should be declarative only. The operator can later consume it during publish/provisioning, but the MVP value is making the node's expected substrates visible to agents and humans.

### M5 - One-command local substrate

Add a node-local command equivalent to Supabase local dev:

```bash
pnpm dev:stack
```

It should start the app plus the minimum local substrates for that node: Postgres, Doltgres when enabled, Redis only if streams are enabled, and any local mock services required by the template.

This is the product MVP. A new node dev should clone the node repo, run one setup command, and see the node operate against local managed substrates.

## Decision Rules

1. Root `packages/*` in the operator monorepo are cross-node packages.
2. Node-at-root `packages/*` are node-owned packages.
3. Schema plus typed client can live in the same node-owned DB package, but env loading cannot.
4. Postgres and Doltgres stay in separate packages because they are separate planes.
5. Graph definitions should be a package; graph process lifecycle, if any, should be a service.
6. Empty packages are avoided unless they are part of the template's first-run experience.
7. The operator never builds node code for a submodule node; it consumes the node's image and metadata.
8. Routine node evolution should be a node PR: Postgres schema, Doltgres schema, graph definitions, contracts, secret declarations, storage/stream declarations, and base runtime shape.
