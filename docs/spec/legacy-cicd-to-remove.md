# Legacy CI/CD To Remove

## North Star

One artifact contract. One promotion primitive. Everything else is policy.

Deployable artifacts are promoted by artifact identity:

```text
source_repo + sourceSha + image_repository
  -> image_repository:sha-<sourceSha>
  -> { target, source_repo, sourceSha, image_repository, digest }
  -> deploy/<env>-<target>
  -> /version.buildSha == sourceSha
```

Anything that uses a pull request number, merge-queue tag, or preview tag as artifact identity is transitional. PR numbers remain review metadata only.

The categories below are about **artifact identity**. The adjacent freeze — where deployment _behavior_ leaks into `.sh` and CI YAML instead of into the substrate — and the routing for all new platform work live in [CI/CD Platform Boundary & Freeze Policy](./cicd-platform-boundary.md). Category 6 below is the bridge between the two.

## Inventory

### PR-shaped image tags — ✅ REMOVED (in-repo artifacts)

**Status (2026-06-23):** Removed for the operator's own in-repo artifacts. `pr-build.yml` now publishes `<image>:sha-<sourceSha>` on `pull_request` / `merge_group` / `push:main` (mirroring node-template); `resolve-pr-build-images.sh` parses `sha-`; `flight-preview.yml` resolves `sha-<mainSha>` directly (the `preview-<sha>` re-tag step is deleted); `promote-and-deploy.yml` resolves `sha-<sourceSha>` for in-repo nodes. The `pr-<n>-<sha>` / `mq-<n>-<sha>` / `preview-<sha>` namespaces no longer exist.

**Original mechanic (historical):** `pr-build.yml`, `resolve-pr-build-images.sh`, and `flight-preview.yml` used `pr-<prNumber>-<headSha>`, `mq-<prNumber>-<queueSha>`, and `preview-<sha>` for in-repo artifacts — a PR-derived lookup namespace, not `source_repo + sourceSha + image_repository`.

**Residual:** `candidate-flight.yml` still accepts a `pr_number` workflow input for the transitional monorepo dispatch lane, but it resolves the same `sha-<headSha>` image (no pr-/mq- tag). Deleting that input + unifying onto `node_slug + source_sha` is tracked under _Candidate PR-number dispatch_ below.

### Candidate PR-number dispatch

**Mechanic:** `candidate-flight.yml` still accepts `pr_number` and `head_sha` workflow inputs for transitional in-repo artifact flights.

**Why it is legacy:** `POST /api/v1/vcs/flight` no longer accepts PR-number deploy identity. The workflow input remains only because in-repo artifacts still have PR-shaped build outputs.

**Why not removed here:** Removing the workflow input before migrating operator-owned in-repo artifacts would strand the current control-plane candidate lane.

**Removal condition:** Candidate flight resolves all targets from source-SHA artifact tags, including operator-owned artifacts. Delete `pr_number`, `head_sha`, PR files API lookup, and PR status reporting from `candidate-flight.yml`.

### In-repo artifact build fan-out

**Mechanic:** `scripts/ci/detect-affected.sh` selects targets this repo must build from catalog path changes. Rows whose `source_repo` is another repo are skipped because their source repo owns the build.

**Why it is legacy:** Parent build fan-out is valid only for deployables whose source repo is still this repo. It must not become a second node model.

**Why not removed here:** `operator`, `resy`, `canary`, and scheduler-worker are not fully represented as source-SHA artifact rows yet.

**Removal condition:** Parent-owned deployables publish `source_repo` + `image_repository` rows and use the same `sha-<sourceSha>` resolver. `detect-affected.sh` remains a build-plane selector only; deploy selection consumes artifact records.

### Preview re-tagging — ✅ REMOVED

**Status (2026-06-23):** Done. The `Re-tag merge_group images as preview-{sha}` step is deleted from `flight-preview.yml`; it now resolves `sha-<mainSha>` (published by pr-build on `merge_group` AND `push:main`) and `promote-and-deploy.yml` resolves the same `sha-<sourceSha>` for in-repo nodes — one digest, carried forward, no mint-a-new-tag step. `promote-preview-seed-main.sh` seeds from `sha-<mergeSha>` too.

**Original mechanic (historical):** `flight-preview.yml` re-tagged merge-queue images into `preview-<mainSha>` for parent-built targets — a new lookup tag instead of carrying the candidate-proven digest forward.

### Digest re-resolution instead of carry-forward

**Mechanic:** Remote-source artifact preview promotion can re-resolve `image_repository:sha-<sourceSha>` after merge rather than consuming the exact artifact record resolved during candidate flight.

**Why it is legacy:** A serious deploy plane resolves once, stores `{ target, source_repo, sourceSha, image_repository, digest }`, and carries that exact digest through candidate, preview, and production. Re-resolution is only equivalent if the source-SHA tag is immutable and never repointed.

**Why not removed here:** This PR is the first vertical slice for remote-source artifact rows. Adding a durable artifact-record store plus cross-workflow carry-forward would widen it into the platform rewrite.

**Removal condition:** Candidate flight writes a durable artifact record for each promoted target; preview and production read that record or a promoted successor record and never re-resolve source-SHA tags after the first accepted resolution.

### Gitlink as source-SHA pin

**Mechanic:** Remote-source artifact preview promotion infers `sourceSha` from the parent repo gitlink at `nodes/<slug>`.

**Why it is transitional:** Gitlinks are a good approval pin, but they are not the fundamental deployment primitive. The artifact coordinate is `source_repo + sourceSha + image_repository`.

**Why not removed here:** The current operator publish/pin PR flow uses gitlinks as the reviewable acceptance record.

**Removal condition:** The operator has an explicit, reviewable source pin record that carries `source_repo`, `sourceSha`, and artifact rows without requiring a submodule checkout shape.

### Deploy-brain in shell + CI YAML

**Mechanic:** `scripts/ci/deploy-infra.sh` (2,167 lines) carries eight responsibilities — SSH/rsync Compose, `.env` assembly threading 70+ secrets via `printf %q`, Postgres/Doltgres/Temporal superuser reconciliation (incl. live `ALTER USER ... PASSWORD`), per-node k8s secret creation, OpenFGA store bootstrap, Argo Image-Updater bootstrap, Caddy edge render, systemd backup timer — mutating candidate-a, preview, and production. The promotion workflows (`candidate-flight.yml` ~1,100 lines, `promote-and-deploy.yml` ~1,000 lines) carry inline digest-resolution decision trees in `run:` blocks.

**Why it is legacy:** A control plane expressed in bash and YAML is an accidental pseudo-platform. Its proper homes are OpenTofu (cloud infra), Argo CD + Kustomize (deploy state), and ESO + OpenBao (secrets). `ci-cd.md` already names `deploy-infra.sh`'s preview/prod `.env` rendering "the remaining transitional copy" (line 243) with the alignment target being to move the VM/Compose tier into k8s (line 326).

**Why not removed here:** It works in production and the k8s/Compose-tier move (Ingress + cert-manager + ESO + a DB-provision Job) is staged, not done. Removing it before its responsibilities land in the substrate would break preview/prod deploys.

**Why not expanded:** Frozen by [CI/CD Platform Boundary & Freeze Policy](./cicd-platform-boundary.md) — no new responsibility, secret, service, DB path, or inline decision tree. Its line count is a ratchet. New platform behavior routes to catalog/overlay/AppSet/ESO, never to more bash.

**Removal condition:** Each responsibility migrates to its substrate home (DB-credential provisioning → Axiom 22 substrate lane; secret delivery → ESO; edge → Ingress+cert-manager; Image-Updater bootstrap → GitOps Application). `deploy-infra.sh` shrinks to a thin Compose-reconcile wrapper or is retired when the VM/Compose tier moves into k8s.
