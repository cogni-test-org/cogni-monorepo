# Node vs Operator Contract

## Context

Cogni architecture separates concerns into two autonomous entities: **Node** (a fully sovereign DAO+app) and **Operator** (a meta-node platform). Node sovereignty is non-negotiable — a Node must be forkable and runnable without any Cogni Operator account or service dependency. This spec defines the contracts that enforce that boundary.

## Goal

Establish enforceable invariants ensuring Node sovereignty, deployment portability, and clean import boundaries between Node and Operator codebases — so that Nodes can always operate independently while optionally consuming Operator services.

## Non-Goals

- Operator implementation details (control plane UX, billing, federation)
- Smart contract specifications (covered by chain-config spec)
- CI/CD pipeline specifics (covered by node-ci-cd-contract spec)

## Core Invariants

1. **WALLET_CUSTODY**: Node's DAO wallet keys never touch Operator infrastructure. Operator never gains treasury or key control.

2. **DATA_SOVEREIGNTY**: Node DB is source of truth. Operator may cache derived data but never requires custody of Node DB or funds.

3. **DEPLOY_INDEPENDENCE**: Node can deploy without Operator (manual or self-hosted CI). `docker compose up` must work as single-host baseline.

4. **FORK_FREEDOM**: Node repo is forkable and runnable without any Cogni Operator account.

5. **UPGRADE_AUTONOMY**: Node decides when/whether to pull upstream changes.

6. **REPO_SPEC_AUTHORITY**: Node authors `.cogni/repo-spec.yml`; Operator consumes snapshot+hash; Operator never invents policy.

7. **NO_CROSS_IMPORTS**: Node code (`src/`, `packages/`) must never import from Operator code (`services/`), and vice versa. Both may import from shared `packages/`.

8. **STATELESS_CONTAINERS**: No durable local filesystem dependencies except ephemeral `/tmp`. Same images across all environments; config via env vars.

9. **HEALTH_ENDPOINTS_REQUIRED**: All deployable services require `/livez` (liveness) and `/readyz` (readiness) endpoints.

10. **GRACEFUL_SHUTDOWN**: SIGTERM triggers drain of in-flight requests within timeout.

## Design

### Definitions

| Term         | Definition                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Node**     | A fully sovereign DAO+app: closed-loop wallet control, crypto payments for deployment/inference/revenue, self-deployable infrastructure. This repo today.                  |
| **Operator** | A Meta-Node (Node++) with control plane + data plane. Same hex architecture and CI/CD rails as Node, but domain is platform governance rather than single-node operations. |
| **Project**  | A governance/payout domain within a Node. Each project has its own DAO address, weight policy, payment rails, and epoch stream. Identified by `scope_id` in the database.  |

### Identity Primitives

The system uses several orthogonal identity keys. Each has a single, non-overlapping purpose. See [Identity Model spec](./identity-model.md) for the full taxonomy.

| Key                  | Type | Purpose                            | Scope                | Overloading Prohibited                            |
| -------------------- | ---- | ---------------------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `node_id`            | UUID | Deployment/instance identity       | Infra, DB tenancy    | Never used for governance domain or epoch scoping |
| `scope_id`           | UUID | Governance/payout domain (project) | Ledger, epochs       | Never used for deployment identity                |
| `user_id`            | UUID | Person identity                    | Cross-node           | Never replaced by wallet address or DID           |
| `billing_account_id` | UUID | Payment/subscription tenancy       | Within a Node's DB   | Never used for governance or deployment identity  |
| `dao_address`        | TEXT | On-chain contract identity         | Per-project on-chain | Attribute, not a database key                     |

**`node_id` = deployment identity only.** One node = one database, one set of infrastructure, one `docker compose up`. Multiple projects (scope_ids) can exist within a single node. `node_id` is never overloaded for governance semantics.

**`scope_id` = governance domain.** Identifies which project an epoch, its activity, and its payouts belong to. V0 default: `scope_id = 'default'` (single-project nodes). Multi-scope activates when `.cogni/projects/*.yaml` manifests are added. All epoch-level invariants (`ONE_OPEN_EPOCH`, `EPOCH_WINDOW_UNIQUE`) are composite on `(node_id, scope_id)`. See [Attribution Ledger spec](./attribution-ledger.md#project-scoping).

### Node Topology — The Bundle Unit & Deployment Shapes

> Colloquially "a node" means a **unique DAO + product + payment bundle**. That bundle is a **scope** (`scope_id`), _not_ necessarily a deployment. Whether it earns its own deployment is an orthogonal choice.

Two orthogonal axes — keep them separate to avoid the recurring "is X a node?" confusion:

1. **Governance unit = scope.** The DAO + product + payment-rails bundle is a `scope_id` (a Project, per the Definitions table above). One node can host many. Declared in `.cogni/projects/<scope_key>.yaml`; see [identity-model § Spec File Layering](./identity-model.md#spec-file-layering).
2. **Deployment shape = how that scope runs.** Independent of the bundle:

| Shape               | Runs as                                                   | Own `node_id`/DB? | git-app / UI? | Example                |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- | ------------- | ---------------------- |
| **Full-app node**   | own `docker compose up`                                   | yes               | yes (Next.js) | poly, resy             |
| **Agent bundle**    | LangGraph graphs + Dolt knowledge inside an existing node | no (shares host)  | no            | librarian, oss-advisor |
| **Service in node** | a `services/*` process within a node                      | no                | no            | scheduler-worker       |
| **Skill**           | a graph/command any node's agent can run                  | no                | no            | `/librarian`           |

**NEW_CAPABILITY_IS_A_SCOPE:** a new DAO+product+payment bundle starts as a **scope inside an existing node** (default: operator), running as an agent bundle/service against that node's Dolt knowledge plane. It graduates to a **full-app node** (own `node_id`, DB, infra) only when it requires `DATA_SOVEREIGNTY`, `DEPLOY_INDEPENDENCE`, or `FORK_FREEDOM` the host cannot provide. Per-scope DAO billing (attribution-ledger `APPROVERS_PER_SCOPE`; dao-enforcement `FALLBACK_SCOPE_RAILS`) lets a scope bill independently **without** a separate deployment — so "langgraph agent bundle + its own DAO + Dolt repo" is a _scope_, not a new node, until it earns sovereignty.

**Planes (do not conflate — there is no single "three-plane" model):** the Operator splits into a **Control Plane** (`apps/operator/`) and **Data Plane** (`services/*`). Orthogonally, every node's _data_ splits into an **Awareness Plane** (hot Postgres) and a **Knowledge Plane** (cold Doltgres `knowledge_<node>`, one DB per node) — see [knowledge-data-plane](./knowledge-data-plane.md). These are two independent two-plane vocabularies, not three planes.

### Operator Architecture

| Layer             | Component        | Purpose                                                                       |
| ----------------- | ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Control Plane** | `apps/operator/` | Governance UX, billing/entitlements, node registry, federation, operator auth |
| **Data Plane**    | `services/*`     | Webhook ingest, PR review execution, repo admin, event processing             |

### Boot Seams Matrix

| Capability          | Node Owns                        | Operator Provides      | Call Direction       | Self-Host Option |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------- | ---------------------- | -------------------- | ---------------- |
| App deployment      | Infra keys, deploy scripts       | —                      | —                    | Always self-host |
| DAO wallet ops      | Wallet keys, signing             | —                      | —                    | Always self-host |
| Incoming payments   | PaymentReceiver contract         | —                      | —                    | Always self-host |
| AI inference (Node) | Provider keys, billing           | —                      | Node → Provider      | Always self-host |
| PR code review      | Manual review                    | git-review-daemon      | Operator → Node repo | OSS standalone   |
| Repo admin actions  | Manual via GitHub UI             | git-admin-daemon       | Operator → Node repo | OSS standalone   |
| Repo-spec policy    | Authors `.cogni/repo-spec.yml`   | Consumes snapshot+hash | Operator reads Node  | —                |
| Project manifests   | Authors `.cogni/projects/*.yaml` | Consumes snapshot+hash | Operator reads Node  | —                |
| Cred scoring        | —                                | cognicred              | Operator internal    | vNext            |

**AI Inference Billing:**

- Node-run inference: Node owns provider keys and pays directly
- Operator-run services (git-review, etc.): Operator pays for inference as cost of service delivery

### Dependency Rules — Code Imports (Compile-Time)

| From                       | To                     | Allowed |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------- | ------- |
| Node (`src/`, `packages/`) | Operator (`services/`) | **NO**  |
| Operator (`services/`)     | Node (`src/`)          | **NO**  |
| Operator (`services/`)     | Shared (`packages/`)   | YES     |
| Node (`src/`)              | Shared (`packages/`)   | YES     |

### Dependency Rules — Runtime Calls

| From     | To                | Allowed        | Mechanism                    |
| -------- | ----------------- | -------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Node     | Operator services | YES (optional) | HTTP API with Node's API key |
| Operator | Node repo         | YES            | VCS API (GitHub/GitLab)      |
| Operator | Node DB           | **NO**         | Never direct access          |
| Operator | Node wallet       | **NO**         | Never custody                |

**Operator Node Registry:** Operator maintains a derived `operator_node_registrations` table for control-plane routing, with per-scope config cached in `operator_node_scopes`. This is rebuildable from repo-spec snapshots (fetched via VCS API). `node_id` (UUID) is the Operator's federation/deployment identity — it identifies a deployed Node instance, not a tenant within the Node. Within a Node's own DB, tenant isolation uses `billing_account_id` (= `billing_accounts.id`); `node_id` is never used for RLS or tenant scoping inside the Node repo. A `node_id` may map to one or many `billing_account_id`s. See [VCS Integration §Node Registration Lifecycle](./vcs-integration.md#node-registration-lifecycle) for the registration schema and reconciliation model, and [Node Formation Spec §9](node-formation.md#9-operator-node-registry-p1) for the formation trigger.

**Scope within a Node:** A single Node deployment (`node_id`) can host multiple governance domains (`scope_id`). Each scope has its own DAO address, weight policy, epoch stream, and payment rails — declared via `.cogni/projects/*.yaml`. The Operator sees scopes as sub-resources of a Node: `node_id` for routing, `scope_id` for governance granularity. Ledger invariants (`ONE_OPEN_EPOCH`, `EPOCH_WINDOW_UNIQUE`) are always composite on `(node_id, scope_id)`. See [Attribution Ledger §Project Scoping](./attribution-ledger.md#project-scoping).

### Deployment Portability

Node is **container-native / K8s-ready** but not Kubernetes-dependent:

| Invariant                   | Meaning                                                     |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Docker Compose Runnable** | Single-host baseline; `docker compose up` must work         |
| **Stateless Containers**    | No durable local FS deps except ephemeral `/tmp`            |
| **Env-Var Configuration**   | Same images across all environments; config via env vars    |
| **Health Endpoints**        | Required `/livez` (liveness) and `/readyz` (readiness)      |
| **Graceful Shutdown**       | SIGTERM triggers drain of in-flight requests within timeout |

**Operator Hosting (vNext):**

- Operator may offer multi-tenant Node hosting on Kubernetes
- Helm charts and K8s manifests are Operator-owned deployment artifacts
- Hosting must not violate custody: Operator never gains treasury or key control

**Design Principle — Mirror Rails, Not Features:**
Operator shares CI/CD, observability, deploy invariants, and hex architecture with Node. Only domain logic differs.

**Self-Host Note:** Operator data plane services (git-review-daemon, git-admin-daemon) will be open-sourced as standalone deployables. Sovereign Nodes can run their own instances without any Cogni Operator account.

### Current State

- **All existing code is Node-owned** — no Operator functionality implemented yet
- Services will be added to this repo first (monorepo phase), then extracted to Operator repo when ready
- Extraction criteria: at least one paid external customer + one real cred-informed payout

### File Pointers

| File                                       | Purpose                            |
| ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| `.cogni/repo-spec.yml`                     | Node's declarative policy          |
| `src/`                                     | Next.js app (Node-owned)           |
| `packages/`                                | Shared pure libraries              |
| `infra/compose/runtime/docker-compose.yml` | Docker Compose deployment baseline |

## Acceptance Checks

**Manual:**

1. Verify `packages/` code has no imports from `src/` or `services/`
2. Verify `services/` code has no imports from `src/`
3. Verify `docker compose up` works without any Operator dependencies
4. Verify `.cogni/repo-spec.yml` exists and is Node-authored

**Automated:**

- `pnpm check` — dependency-cruiser enforces import boundary rules
