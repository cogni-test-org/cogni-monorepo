summary: Required-status-checks policy for the merge queue. GitHub's queue waits forever for required checks whose workflows lack a `merge_group:` trigger — verified empirically. Spec defines the resulting flat single-tier policy, the stub-job escape hatch for "PR-only intent" checks, and the GitLab Merge Trains port.
read_when: Adding/removing a required status check; debugging a stuck merge queue; setting up `main`-branch protection on a Cogni-DAO node fork; planning the GitLab vFuture port.

# Merge Queue Required Checks — Policy & Empirical Constraints

## Context

The merge queue's load-bearing job is **anchoring preview-environment image content to the merged tree** (see [development-lifecycle.md](./development-lifecycle.md) Step 8 + task.0391). PR #1083 (the merge-queue rollout) got stuck in the queue waiting for `CodeQL` and `Validate PR title` to report on the queue ref — they never did, because their workflows have no `merge_group:` trigger. The natural intuition was to express **two distinct gates** (full strictness for PR merge, narrow set for the queue) on the assumption that GitHub Rulesets supports event-specific required-checks lists. That assumption was tested and falsified.

## Goal

Define the required-status-checks policy that actually works on GitHub today, capture the empirical finding behind it, and specify the portable shape for GitLab Merge Trains in vFuture. The fixture in `infra/github/` is canonical for any node-shaped fork.

## Non-Goals

- Defining the candidate-a `deploy_verified` gate — see [development-lifecycle.md](./development-lifecycle.md).
- Per-node merge queues — discarded after analysis (see task.0391); revisit if N > 5 nodes or queue depth becomes a real bottleneck.
- Reconciler workflows that auto-apply the config — deferred until drift becomes a recurring issue.

## Core Invariants

1. **REPORT_OR_DON'T_REQUIRE**: A required status check MUST be produced by a workflow that fires on both `pull_request:` AND `merge_group:` events. PR-only workflows cannot be required — the queue would wait forever for a status that never arrives. Empirically validated.
2. **QUEUE_GATE_IS_TREE_CORRECTNESS**: The queue's required-set's load-bearing entry is the image-build aggregator (`manifest`), which proves the rebased tree built into a usable image. Other entries are cheap deterministic checks (`static`, `unit`, `component`).
3. **STUB_JOB_FOR_PR_INTENT**: When a check's "real validation" only makes sense on PR-time (e.g., title convention, security scan, candidate-a flight), the workflow MAY add a `merge_group:` trigger with a no-op passthrough step that emits a success status with the same context name. This makes the check visible on both events without doing duplicate work on the queue ref. **Canonical example: `candidate-flight`** — required-on-PR (every external-agent contribution must dispatch `/vcs/flight` and pass), but explicitly NOT required-on-merge-queue (the queue's rebased SHA is different from the PR head; re-flighting it would conflict with the slot lease and waste a candidate-a deploy). Implementation: `candidate-flight.yml` adds `merge_group:` trigger + a passthrough job that emits `candidate-flight` success on merge_group events. Spec'd; implementation tracked in task.0414.
4. **CONFIG_AS_CODE**: The set of required checks is committed to `infra/github/branch-protection.json`. Drift between live and committed is detectable (`gh api ... | diff`).

## The Empirical Finding (2026-04-28)

Hypothesis tested in `Cogni-DAO/test-repo` PR #53:

> When a required status check's workflow has no `merge_group:` trigger, does GitHub's merge queue (a) wait forever or (b) skip it because no workflow is registered to produce it?

Test setup:

- `mq-test-both.yml` — fires on `pull_request` AND `merge_group`. Always passes.
- `mq-test-pr-only.yml` — fires on `pull_request` only. Always passes.
- Branch protection: required checks `[mq-test-both, mq-test-pr-only]` + merge queue enabled (Rulesets API).

Observed behavior on the queued PR:

```
mq-test-pr-only Expected — Waiting for status to be reported
Required
@github-actions
mq-test-both Successful in 2s
```

Queue stayed in `AWAITING_CHECKS` indefinitely. **Outcome (a) confirmed.** Rulesets does not change this behavior vs classic branch protection — both surface the same merge-queue waiting semantics.

This kills the "Tier 1 strict / Tier 2 narrow via Rulesets" approach. The remaining options are:

- (i) Restrict required-checks to those that fire on both events (chosen). Lose pre-merge enforcement of CodeQL and Validate PR title — they remain advisory on PR-time but cannot block merge.
- (ii) Stub-job pattern (see `STUB_JOB_FOR_PR_INTENT` invariant) — add `merge_group:` triggers + passthrough success to PR-only workflows so they can be required.

We ship (i) today (smaller blast radius, no per-workflow edits) and reserve (ii) for cases where losing the PR-only check as a hard gate is unacceptable.

## Required Status Checks (canonical set)

Set committed to [`infra/github/branch-protection.json`](../../infra/github/branch-protection.json):

| Context     | Workflow       | Why required                                                                                           |
| ----------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `static`    | `ci.yaml`      | Typecheck + lint. Cheap; catches base-incompatibility on rebase.                                       |
| `unit`      | `ci.yaml`      | Unit + format + arch + docs. Cheap; catches base-incompatibility on rebase.                            |
| `component` | `ci.yaml`      | Testcontainers component-level integration.                                                            |
| `manifest`  | `pr-build.yml` | **Load-bearing**: rebased-tree image build. Without this, `flight-preview` re-tags pre-rebase content. |

All four workflows fire on both `pull_request:` and `merge_group:`.

Excluded from required (advisory on PR-time only):

| Context             | Workflow                  | Why excluded from required                                                                                                                                               |
| ------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `CodeQL`            | (org-level default-setup) | No `merge_group:` trigger. Required → queue waits forever (see Empirical Finding). Still scans on PR + reports to Security tab.                                          |
| `Validate PR title` | `pr-lint.yaml`            | No `merge_group:` trigger. Title convention is honor-system post-queue.                                                                                                  |
| `stack-test`        | `ci.yaml`                 | Fires on `merge_group` but is flaky; ~10 min on the rebased candidate doubles flake surface. Real integration validation lives at candidate-a via `/validate-candidate`. |

### Pending — `candidate-flight` (task.0414)

`candidate-flight` is the contract gate for external-agent contributions: every PR must dispatch `/vcs/flight` and pass before merge. It is therefore required-on-PR. But it MUST NOT gate the merge queue — the queue's rebased SHA differs from the PR head, and re-flighting it would conflict with the candidate-slot lease and waste a candidate-a deploy.

This is the canonical use of `STUB_JOB_FOR_PR_INTENT`: `candidate-flight.yml` will gain a `merge_group:` trigger with a passthrough job that emits `candidate-flight` success on merge_group events. Implementation tracked in `task.0414`. Once shipped, the canonical required set becomes `unit, component, static, manifest, candidate-flight` — the first stub-job-pattern entry in the live config.

## Implementation — Classic Protection (checks) + a `merge_queue` Ruleset (queue)

Two orthogonal layers, both config-as-code, applied by `bash infra/github/setup-main-branch.sh [<owner>/<repo>]`:

- **Required-status-checks → classic branch protection.** Stay on classic protection for the checks set. Rulesets give no additional flexibility for the _event-specific required-checks-list_ problem (the falsified hypothesis below) — so there is no reason to migrate the checks. The fixture is `infra/github/branch-protection.json` → `PUT /repos/{repo}/branches/main/protection`.
- **Queue requirement → a `merge_queue` ruleset.** The fixture is `infra/github/merge-queue-ruleset.json` → `POST`/`PUT /repos/{repo}/rulesets` (idempotent find-by-name).

**The queue toggle is no longer UI-only.** Classic protection's `PUT .../protection` silently drops `required_merge_queue` — but that is a limitation of the _classic protection endpoint_, not of GitHub. The **rulesets** API carries the queue: a `merge_queue` rule is REST-settable (the 2026-04-28 experiment below in fact enabled the queue via the rulesets API). So the queue is now applied programmatically alongside the checks; the manual Settings → Branches checkbox is retired. The ruleset carries _only_ the `merge_queue` rule (not the checks), so it does not re-open the rejected "rulesets for required-checks lists" path.

> Migration note: a repo that previously had the queue enabled via the classic UI checkbox should keep the ruleset as the single source of truth — the ruleset is authoritative and the legacy checkbox can be cleared once the ruleset is confirmed live (`gh api repos/{repo}/rulesets`).

## GitLab vFuture Mapping

GitLab's Merge Trains is the equivalent vendor primitive. The `REPORT_OR_DON'T_REQUIRE` invariant survives migration verbatim — the syntax changes, the policy doesn't.

| GitHub concept                            | GitLab equivalent                                                            |
| ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Branch (`main`)                           | Protected branch (`main`)                                                    |
| Classic branch protection required-checks | "Pipelines must succeed before merge" + per-job `rules:` in `.gitlab-ci.yml` |
| Merge Queue                               | **Merge Trains**                                                             |
| `merge_group:` workflow trigger           | `rules: - if: $CI_PIPELINE_SOURCE == "merge_train"` per-job                  |
| `pull_request:` workflow trigger          | `rules: - if: $CI_PIPELINE_SOURCE == "merge_request_event"` per-job          |
| `setup-main-branch.sh`                    | Project Settings API + per-job rules in `.gitlab-ci.yml`                     |

The GitLab-native shape of the policy:

```yaml
# .gitlab-ci.yml
unit:
  rules:
    - if: $CI_PIPELINE_SOURCE == "merge_request_event"
    - if: $CI_PIPELINE_SOURCE == "merge_train"
  script: pnpm test:ci

# Stub-job equivalent for PR-only intent (the GitLab analog of STUB_JOB_FOR_PR_INTENT).
title-validate:
  rules:
    - if: $CI_PIPELINE_SOURCE == "merge_request_event"
      when: on_success
    - if: $CI_PIPELINE_SOURCE == "merge_train"
      when: on_success
  script:
    - if [ "$CI_PIPELINE_SOURCE" = "merge_train" ]; then echo "validated at MR-time"; exit 0; fi
    - validate-conventional-commit-title.sh "$CI_MERGE_REQUEST_TITLE"
```

Tier 1 enforcement in GitLab is "the MR pipeline must succeed end-to-end" (project Setting → "Pipelines must succeed before merge"). There is no per-context required-checks list — every job in the MR pipeline must succeed. This is actually cleaner than GitHub's per-context model: the same YAML drives both the gate and the artifact.

The portability boundary stays clean: workflow YAML changes (per-trigger → per-job rules), policy survives.

## Acceptance Checks

**Automated:**

- `pnpm check:docs` validates this spec's frontmatter and links.
- `setup-main-branch.sh` is idempotent (re-running does not change live state).

**Manual:**

1. After applying via `setup-main-branch.sh`: verify `gh api .../branches/main/protection | jq '.required_status_checks.contexts'` returns the four canonical checks.
2. Verify the queue ruleset is live: `gh api repos/{repo}/rulesets --jq '.[] | select(.name=="main-merge-queue") | .enforcement'` returns `active` (the script also confirms via GraphQL `mergeQueue`). Then open a no-op docs PR; click "Merge when ready"; queue accepts after the four checks report on the merge_group ref. Should complete within ~5 min.
3. Drift detection: re-run the diff in `infra/github/README.md` against live; should be empty.
