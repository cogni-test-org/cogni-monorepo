# Secrets Management Contract

## Context

Cogni node-template runs AI agents as primary committers. Every secret a human or agent touches is a potential exfiltration vector. The Tier-1 substrate (`task.0284`) is **External Secrets Operator + OpenBao**, both Apache 2.0 OSS, both Argo-idiomatic. This spec is the contract that the substrate satisfies and that every downstream consumer (services, guides, CLI tooling, GitHub workflows, operator MCP tools) MUST conform to.

The spec follows published guidance from:

- [External Secrets Operator documentation](https://external-secrets.io/) — the `dataFrom: extract` pattern is documented as the canonical "fetch all keys at a path" consumption shape
- [OpenBao documentation](https://openbao.org/docs/) — KV v2 path conventions + versioned secrets + audit log
- [HashiCorp Vault best practices](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/tutorials/policies/policy-templating) — RBAC via path-template policies (inherited by OpenBao)
- [Stakater Reloader](https://github.com/stakater/Reloader) — vendor-blessed zero-downtime restart on Secret/ConfigMap change
- [OWASP Secrets Management Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Secrets_Management_Cheat_Sheet.html)
- [NIST SP 800-57 Part 1 Rev 5](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-57-part-1/rev-5/final) — key lifecycle (generate, distribute, store, use, rotate, retire, destroy)
- SOC 2 Trust Service Criteria CC6.1 / CC6.6 / CC7.2 / CC8.1

This spec deliberately does NOT invent new patterns where published guidance exists. Cite the source if you disagree with a rule here; do not re-invent.

## Goal

A human or AI agent can declare a new secret, rotate an existing secret, or revoke access **without touching pod specs, kustomize overlays, or any committed YAML** beyond the one-time-per-service `ExternalSecret` resource. The act of adding/rotating a secret is a control-plane operation against OpenBao, not a code change.

## Non-Goals

- Encrypted-secrets-in-git patterns (Sealed Secrets, SOPS+ksops). Rejected — see `proj.security-hardening` Design Notes.
- Multi-tenant SaaS KMS (Tier-2). See `task.5051` under `proj.operator-plane`.
- Full Compose-runtime secret elimination via Bao Agent or k3s migration. Compose
  services still read rendered `.env` files, but established ESO environments
  must render runtime values from OpenBao rather than GitHub env secrets. **Now in
  scope:** the pod-consumed **DB role passwords** and critical shared runtime
  values (`LITELLM_MASTER_KEY`, `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, `GH_WEBHOOK_SECRET`,
  `OPENFGA_DB_PASSWORD`, `TEMPORAL_DB_PASSWORD`, and scheduler-worker's operator
  ledger DSN) whose Compose / bridge renderers must read OpenBao instead of a
  GitHub-secret `.env` (see
  [DB-credential provisioning](#db-credential-provisioning--the-composek8s-boundary-bug5002-invariant-15)).

---

## Authority Model

Do not use the catalog `tier` as the authority model. Tiers say where a value
is commonly routed; they do not decide who owns the value. Every secret
decision has three separate axes:

| Axis        | Values                                   | Answers                                      |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `origin`    | `agent` · `human` · `derived`            | Who can produce the bytes?                   |
| `custody`   | `openbao` · `github-env` · `repo-config` | Which system is authoritative?               |
| `consumers` | `pod` · `compose` · `ci` · `external`    | Where is the value rendered or synchronized? |

The default custody for runtime secrets is `openbao`. GitHub Environment
Secrets may bootstrap access and carry CI-only credentials, but they are not
the source of truth for app/runtime credentials. VM `.env` files are rendered
views for Compose consumers, never authorities.

The hard rule:

> If a value is consumed by a pod, provisions a pod-facing role, or must agree
> with a pod-facing value, its custody is OpenBao.

Examples:

- `POSTGRES_ROOT_PASSWORD` may remain Compose/bootstrap-only for now because no
  pod should consume it.
- `APP_DB_PASSWORD`, `APP_DB_SERVICE_PASSWORD`,
  `APP_DB_READONLY_PASSWORD`, `DOLTGRES_PASSWORD`,
  `DOLTGRES_READER_PASSWORD`, and `DOLTGRES_WRITER_PASSWORD` are
  OpenBao-custodied even though Compose provisioners render copies. They create
  or support pod-facing DSNs, Grafana datasources, or node substrate.
- Non-secret public URLs and feature modes are repo/GitOps config, not
  OpenBao.

## Self-Serve Model (read this first)

The whole point: **any node developer adds a secret to their own running node — in one PR, with no
kubectl, no PAT, no laptop root token, and without waiting on the operator.** The platform spawns N
node forks; secret provisioning cannot be a bottleneck that routes through one person.

Adding a secret is **two atoms**, each self-serve:

```
┌── ① DECLARE (one PR, your node domain) ─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Edit nodes/<node>/.cogni/secrets-catalog.yaml — one entry: name, tier,     │
│  appliesTo, shared, source.  The Zod loader validates it at load time.      │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                                   │  the catalog is the ONE list the provisioner reads
                                   ▼
┌── ② MATERIALIZE / WRITE THE VALUE ──────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  source: agent   → secret-materialize generates once per env/node.          │
│  source: derived → materializer derives from non-secret + OpenBao-owned     │
│                   inputs.                                                   │
│  source: human   → set through secret-set/operator API before flight;        │
│                   materializer fails loud if absent.                         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                                   ▼
   OpenBao  cogni/<env>/<service>/<KEY>   ← single source of truth
                                   ▼  ESO dataFrom: extract (one ExternalSecret per service-env)
   k8s Secret  <service>-env-secrets
                                   ▼  Stakater Reloader (envFrom is read once, at start)
   Pod rolling-restarts → process.env.<KEY> is live.   Zero pod-spec edits.
```

**Why this is the design (and what it replaces).** Atom ① only works if the provisioner derives its
fan-out **from the catalog**. Historically three hand-maintained lists decided which keys reached a
pod — `reconcile-secrets.sh::NODE_BASELINE_KEYS`, `provision-env.yml`'s per-secret `env:` block, and
the `bootstrap.sh` `.env` heredoc — and they drifted from the catalog. `DOLTHUB_*`/`DOLT_CREDS_*`
were declared catalog **A1** yet absent from all three lists, so the DoltHub mirror sat dormant: the
living proof that a catalog entry is inert until a human hand-propagates it. The
[`CATALOG_IS_THE_ONE_READER`](#core-invariants) invariant retires those lists — the catalog is the
only declaration surface, read by one loader (`scripts/lib/secrets-catalog-loader.ts`), so a node
dev's one-PR catalog edit actually fans out.

**Per-node _gating_ is already catalog-driven** (`_node_gets_key` resolves `appliesTo`/`service`); the
remaining work is making the key **universe** catalog-derived too, so declaration is genuinely
self-serve. The catalog model (capability-gated, distinct-vs-shared custody line) is specified in
[`docs/design/secrets-catalog-per-node.md`](../design/secrets-catalog-per-node.md).

## New Node Wizard Contract

A wizard-created node does **not** require a human to set a new secret value for
that node. Node formation is allowed to consume the environment's existing
DAO/org values, but node-local material is generated or derived by the secrets
substrate.

The node-formation contract lives in
[`secrets-classification.md`](./secrets-classification.md#node-wizard-formation-contract).
For a normal non-payment wizard node, the per-node human-secret list is empty.
If a shared/environment value is needed and absent, the correct fix is to
repair that environment bank before flight. Candidate flight must not accept
the value as a workflow input and the wizard must not store it.

V0 implementation checkpoint for PR #1582:

1. Node formation PR declares shape in git.
2. Candidate flight runs the narrow node substrate readiness lane before the
   read-only assertion.
3. That lane preserves existing `cogni/<env>/<node>` values, fills generated
   node-local values, denormalizes the existing environment values the node is
   allowed to consume, applies the ExternalSecret, updates edge/DB inventory,
   and runs targeted DB provisioners.
4. The scorecard proves ESO sync, DB rows, edge route, `/version`, and
   `/readyz` for the new node.

This v0 lane is not the final shared backend. The next implementation PR should
split `secret-materialize <env> <node>` from substrate reconcile and replace
historical fallback copying with an explicit OpenBao shared-bank /
owner-grant model. Until that lands, docs and PR descriptions must name the v0
lane as transitional.

---

## Core Invariants

1. **PATH_CONVENTION_PER_SERVICE_PER_ENV.** Every secret lives at `cogni/<env>/<service>` in OpenBao KV v2, with the secret name as a key at that path. `<env>` ∈ {`candidate-a`, `preview`, `production`}; `<service>` is the catalog name (`node-template`, `scheduler-worker`, …). One path per (service, env). Multiple keys per path.

2. **ONE_EXTERNAL_SECRET_PER_SERVICE_ENV.** Each service-env pair has exactly ONE `ExternalSecret` resource, created at first deploy, never edited when secrets are added. It uses `dataFrom: extract: key: cogni/<env>/<service>` to pull every key at the path into a single k8s `Secret` named `<service>-env-secrets`.

3. **POD_CONSUMES_VIA_ENVFROM.** Pod specs reference the synced k8s Secret via `envFrom: - secretRef: name: <service>-env-secrets`. ONE line per container, set ONCE at service creation. Adding/removing/rotating secrets does NOT edit pod specs. (Reference: [ESO `dataFrom` pattern](https://external-secrets.io/latest/api/externalsecret/#external-secrets.io/v1.ExternalSecretDataFromRemoteRef).)

4. **NO_VALUE_IN_GIT.** Secret values never enter git history, PR diffs, GitHub Actions logs, chat transcripts, or AI agent context. Only secret NAMES and PATHS appear in committed YAML. Violation = immediate rotation + audit.

5. **OPENBAO_IS_SINGLE_SOURCE_OF_TRUTH.** Every runtime consumer (k8s pods via ESO, Compose renderers for pod-facing dependencies, CLI users via `bao` client, operator MCP tools) reads from OpenBao. No parallel runtime store. GitHub env secrets contain ONLY the `OPENBAO_SEED_TOKEN` per env plus a small allowlist of CI-only/bootstrap credentials documented per-secret. VM `.env` files are rendered views and MUST NOT be treated as authorities for app/runtime credentials.

6. **RBAC_VIA_PATH_POLICY.** OpenBao policies grant access on path prefixes. `cogni/<env>/<service>/*` access is granted to the `<service>-<env>-reader` (read) and `<service>-<env>-writer` (read+write) roles. Pods authenticate via Kubernetes auth method; humans via OIDC; agents via the operator's mediated token. (Reference: [Vault policy templating](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/tutorials/policies/policy-templating).)

7. **VERSIONED_KV_IS_AUDIT_SUBSTRATE.** OpenBao KV v2 retains prior versions per path. Rotation = `bao kv patch` (preserves other keys at the path; adds a new version). Never `bao kv destroy` a version pre-incident. Default retention: ≥10 versions per path; production-critical paths configured for ≥50.

8. **EVERY_ACCESS_AUDITED.** OpenBao audit device enabled; logs shipped to Loki via Alloy. Every read, write, rotate, delete is captured with actor identity (Kubernetes ServiceAccount, OIDC subject, or operator-MCP token), timestamp, path, and outcome. SOC 2 CC7.2 anomaly detection layers on top of this stream.

9. **TOOLING_IS_THE_INTERFACE.** Humans/agents NEVER call `bao kv put` directly in production paths. Three standardized entry points (all calling the same primitive):
   - **CLI:** `pnpm secrets:set <env> <service> <KEY>` (developer; interactive; never echoes values; requires caller-provided `BAO_ADDR` + short-lived `BAO_TOKEN` — see Invariant 13). For candidate experimentation.
   - **GitHub workflow:** `.github/workflows/secret-set.yml` — **per-operation** (never a generic `secrets-manage.yml` catch-all), `workflow_dispatch` with non-secret inputs `{env, service, key}`. Authenticates GH Actions OIDC → OpenBao `jwt` auth (`gha-<env>-writer` role, bound to `sub=repo:<owner>/<repo>:environment:<env>` → existing `<env>-writer` policy), then `bao kv patch`. **The value is NOT a dispatch input** (dispatch inputs are visible in run metadata → would violate Invariant 4); it is read from a sealed GH Environment Secret the dev stages via `gh secret set` (libsodium, write-only, masked in logs). `environment:<env>` makes production's GH-environment protection rule gate the token mint. This is the day-2 self-serve path; in the fork model each node owns its own OpenBao, so reachability is per-fork, not a shared-exposure decision.
   - **Operator API:** `POST /api/v1/secrets/declare` (AI agents via operator MCP; out of scope for node-template — operator monorepo construct)
     Substrate shipped: the `<env>-writer` policy + `gha-<env>-writer` JWT role are provisioned in `provision-env-vm.sh` Phase 5b. The killer rule — **no human ever types a secret VALUE into a plaintext form/UI** — is upheld: values arrive only via the sealed GH secret store, `gh secret set` stdin, or agent generation.

10. **SEED_TOKEN_IS_NEVER_TOUCHED_MANUALLY.** The `OPENBAO_SEED_TOKEN` (the one secret in GH env secrets per env) is written ONCE by `bootstrap.sh` and rotated only by automated mechanisms (operator-app rotation cron or Kubernetes auth method renewal). No human or agent ever runs `gh secret set OPENBAO_SEED_TOKEN` manually post-bootstrap.

11. **ROTATION_DOES_NOT_EDIT_GIT.** Routine rotation is a control-plane operation (`bao kv patch`). The k8s Secret is synced by ESO automatically; the pod is restarted by Stakater Reloader when it detects the Secret change. Zero PRs for rotation. Reloader is installed as the third substrate Argo app (`infra/k8s/argocd/reloader/`); the shared node-app Deployment carries `reloader.stakater.com/auto: "true"`. **This is load-bearing, not cosmetic:** `envFrom` is read once at container start, so without Reloader an ESO-synced value change never reaches a running pod — a day-2 write or rotation would be silently inert until the next unrelated rollout.

12. **TRANSITION_SAFE.** When ESO is wired but a specific path is empty (cold-start), the pod fails to start (loud, not silent). When a path exists but a specific key is missing, that env var is unset (Go/Node default semantics). Code that requires a secret MUST fail fast at startup with a clear error referencing the missing key NAME (not VALUE).

13. **NO_OPERATOR_ROOT_TOKEN_ON_LAPTOP.** The bootstrap root token captured by `provision-env-vm.sh` Phase 5b exists during the ~30 min provisioning window only — Phases 5b.3 (eso-reader policy + role), 5b.4 (`<env>-writer` policy + role binding to `default/openbao-operator`), and 5c (initial path seeding) use it imperatively; nothing reads `.local/<env>-openbao-root-token` after Phase 5b exits. Day-2 secret writes mint a short-lived bao token via the writer role:

    ```
    export BAO_TOKEN=$(bao write -field=token auth/kubernetes/login \
      role=<env>-writer \
      jwt=$(kubectl create token openbao-operator -n default))
    ```

    (The `bao login -method=kubernetes` client helper is not in OpenBao CLI 2.5.x; the raw API path above is portable across CLI versions.)
    No script reads the bootstrap root token from disk post-bootstrap; no SSH-to-VM-then-kubectl-exec-as-root path exists. The bootstrap window itself is tolerated as the bounded "trust the operator's laptop" moment — v2 closes even this gap by moving provisioning to a GitHub workflow (operator triggers `gh workflow run provision-env.yml`; root token never touches a laptop). Tracked in the follow-up bug. Violation today = re-exporting the root token from `.local/` for day-2 writes, which would re-create the long-lived-superuser-credential-on-a-laptop pattern that `proj.security-hardening`'s motivating incident exists to eliminate.

14. **CATALOG_IS_THE_ONE_READER.** The set of keys that fan out to a pod is derived **only** from the secrets catalog (`infra/secrets-catalog.yaml` + `nodes/<node>/.cogni/secrets-catalog.yaml`), read through the single Zod loader (`scripts/lib/secrets-catalog-loader.ts`). No hand-maintained parallel list may decide pod fan-out — specifically `reconcile-secrets.sh::NODE_BASELINE_KEYS`, the per-secret `env:` map in `provision-env.yml`, and the `bootstrap.sh` `.env` heredoc are derived from the loader (e.g. a `--print-pod-keys <node>` emitter the bash side consumes), never independently authored. A catalog entry is the **declaration**; declaration must imply fan-out. Drift guard: `secrets-fanout.test.sh` fails closed if a catalog pod-key is not in the derived set. This is what makes Atom ① of the self-serve model real — a node dev's one-PR catalog edit reaches the pod without any operator-domain hand-edit. (Per-node _membership_ is already catalog-gated via `_node_gets_key`/`appliesTo`; this invariant extends the same SSOT to the key **universe**.)

15. **DB_ROLE_CREDS_ARE_OPENBAO_OWNED** (bug.5002 — the corollary of `OPENBAO_IS_SINGLE_SOURCE_OF_TRUTH` at the Compose↔k8s boundary). The DB role passwords a k8s pod authenticates with, or any password that must agree with a pod-facing DSN, are **owned by OpenBao**. This includes `APP_DB_PASSWORD`, `APP_DB_SERVICE_PASSWORD`, `APP_DB_READONLY_PASSWORD`, `DOLTGRES_PASSWORD`, `DOLTGRES_READER_PASSWORD`, and `DOLTGRES_WRITER_PASSWORD`. They may be rendered into Compose for role creation, Grafana datasource provisioning, or other substrate work, but Compose does not own them. `deploy-infra.sh` / `db-provision` / `doltgres-provision` MUST NOT be a **second writer** of these passwords: they create each role **once** from the OpenBao-sourced value and **never `ALTER … PASSWORD` from a rendered `.env`** on a later run. A `.env` rendered from GitHub env secrets is a parallel store (Invariant 5 violation); ALTERing the DB to it diverges from the value ESO syncs to the pod → `28P01 password authentication failed` → `/readyz` "infrastructure unreachable" → 502 (the candidate-a 2026-06-04 cluster-wide outage). The Compose **superuser** (`POSTGRES_ROOT_PASSWORD`) is exempt while no pod consumes it, but it too is set-once at init, never "reconciled" to a divergent source. **The fix for a provisioning auth failure is to align the source (point `db-provision` at OpenBao), never to overwrite the DB from `.env`.**

    All six are OpenBao-owned; they differ only in how `secret-materialize` produces the value, never in custody. `APP_DB_PASSWORD` and `APP_DB_SERVICE_PASSWORD` are `source: agent` — generated once. The three `DOLTGRES_*` passwords and `APP_DB_READONLY_PASSWORD` are `source: derived` — the materializer computes them from the OpenBao-owned `POSTGRES_ROOT_PASSWORD` and **writes the result back to OpenBao**, so ESO syncs the actual value to the pod. The deterministic derivation that lives inside `deploy-infra.sh` / `doltgres-provision` today (`infra/compose/runtime/AGENTS.md`) is the **legacy bespoke handling Phase 2 replaces**, not the target: a password computed in a deploy script and never written to OpenBao is a parallel store — the same drift class as a rendered `.env`. Target: `deploy-infra` / `db-provision` / `doltgres-provision` **read** every DB password from OpenBao (set-once create), and derive none.

16. **NODE_SECRET_MATERIALIZATION_PRECEDES_SUBSTRATE_RECONCILE.** A new node's first flight/promotion runs a materialization phase before any DB/edge/ExternalSecret substrate reconcile or read-only substrate assertion. In the final form this is a standalone `secret-materialize <env> <node>` primitive: it reads the catalog, preserves existing OpenBao values, generates missing `source: agent` values, derives values only from non-secret inputs plus OpenBao-owned secret inputs, inherits only explicitly granted shared values, and logs key names only. It must not require per-node human values for ordinary wizard nodes; missing shared DAO/org values are environment precondition failures. Candidate flight and promote workflows MUST NOT accept secret values as inputs.

    The write/read split is a **token boundary**: in the target, only `secret-materialize` holds the `<env>-writer` role; `reconcile-substrate` and `assert-substrate` hold a read-only (`<env>-db-reader`) token and perform zero OpenBao writes (no `bao kv put`/`patch`). **Transitional exception (as-built, PR #1582):** `reconcile-substrate` still mints `<env>-writer` to seed the DB DSNs (`DATABASE_URL`, `DATABASE_SERVICE_URL`, `DOLTGRES_URL`) until the env-repair lane lands per-node DB creds at `cogni/<env>/<node>` (`vm-secrets-repair.md`, #1584). The read-only-reconcile target — and the falsifying gate (delete the VM `.env` `APP_DB_PASSWORD`, prove the node deploys green from OpenBao only) — hold only after that lane completes; #1582 must not claim `deploy_verified` via that gate. The catalog-custody surface (`inheritFrom`, DB-key tiering) is the orthogonal, non-blocking lane.

## Design

### Path convention

```text
cogni/<env>/<service>           # KV v2 path
  <KEY_1>                       # key 1
  <KEY_2>                       # key 2
  <KEY_3>                       # key 3
```

`<env>` ∈ `candidate-a` | `preview` | `production`. `<service>` matches `infra/catalog/<service>.yaml::name`. Multiple keys per path; one path per (service, env).

Cross-service secrets live at `cogni/<env>/_shared` and are referenced by
services that explicitly opt in. Use sparingly — per-service paths are the
default. Concrete key classifications live in
[`secrets-classification.md`](./secrets-classification.md).

System-level secrets live at `cogni/<env>/_system`, written by provisioning
lanes and read by CI workflows via OIDC.

### Consumption pattern — ExternalSecret with `dataFrom: extract`

```yaml
# nodes/<node>/k8s/external-secrets/<env>/external-secret.yaml
apiVersion: external-secrets.io/v1
kind: ExternalSecret
metadata:
  name: <service>-env-secrets
spec:
  refreshInterval: 1h # See "Refresh intervals" below
  secretStoreRef:
    name: openbao-backend # ClusterSecretStore defined at install time
    kind: ClusterSecretStore
  target:
    name: <service>-env-secrets # The k8s Secret that ESO writes
    creationPolicy: Owner
    deletionPolicy: Retain # See "Why Retain" below
  dataFrom:
    - extract:
        key: cogni/<env>/<service> # Pulls ALL keys at this path
```

This is created ONCE per (service, env) at service-creation time. It is NOT edited when secrets are added — adding a key at `cogni/<env>/<service>` in OpenBao is automatically picked up on the next refresh.

**Why Retain deletion policy:** if the ExternalSecret is accidentally deleted (kustomize misconfiguration, branch churn), the k8s Secret persists and pods keep running. The next reconcile recreates the ExternalSecret and resumes sync. Failure-mode-safe.

**Refresh intervals (per-class defaults):**

| Class                    | refreshInterval | Rationale                                                                                            |
| ------------------------ | --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Routine app secrets      | `1h`            | Balance between rotation latency and OpenBao read pressure                                           |
| External API keys        | `24h`           | Rotation is rare; reduce upstream rate-limit pressure                                                |
| DB credentials (dynamic) | `15m`           | OpenBao DB engine issues short-lived creds; refresh before TTL                                       |
| Critical (e.g., AEAD)    | `5m`            | Tight rotation window for financial-state material; pair with explicit force-sync hook for emergency |

Emergency force-sync: `kubectl annotate externalsecret <name> force-sync=$(date +%s) --overwrite`. Documented in `docs/guides/secrets-rotate.md`.

### Consumption pattern — pod spec

```yaml
# infra/k8s/base/<service>/deployment.yaml (excerpt; created ONCE)
spec:
  template:
    metadata:
      annotations:
        reloader.stakater.com/auto: "true" # Pod auto-restarts on Secret change
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: app
          envFrom:
            - secretRef:
                name: <service>-env-secrets # ONE reference; pulls all keys
```

This is set ONCE at service creation. **Adding a new env var that the code reads = NO POD SPEC EDIT. Just write the secret to OpenBao + push the code that consumes `process.env.NEW_KEY`.**

### DB-credential provisioning — the Compose↔k8s boundary (bug.5002, Invariant 15)

Postgres and Doltgres run as **Compose-on-VM** services, while the node-apps that consume them run as **k8s pods** (ESO-fed). The DB **role** passwords straddle that boundary, and that seam is where a split-brain festers:

- The **pod** reads its `DATABASE_URL` / `DOLTGRES_URL` (role name + password) from `cogni/<env>/<service>` in OpenBao via ESO. **OpenBao is the pod's SSOT.**
- **`deploy-infra.sh` / `db-provision` / `doltgres-provision`** create the matching DB roles **set-once** and never `ALTER … PASSWORD` on a later run (the #1500/#1502 fix).

**Current state (as-built) — the split-brain is dormant, not gone.** `db-provision` set each role's create-time password from `deploy-infra`'s rendered `.env`, and that `.env` has historically been rendered from **GitHub env secrets** (`APP_DB_PASSWORD`, `APP_DB_SERVICE_PASSWORD`; the readonly + Doltgres roles were derived from `POSTGRES_ROOT_PASSWORD`). It equals the OpenBao value **only by construction** when both stores were seeded from the same bootstrap inputs. Nothing enforces lockstep: rotate the GH secret (or `bao kv patch` OpenBao) independently and the two diverge silently. Set-once removed the _landmine_ (the per-deploy `ALTER` that turned dormant drift into an active 502) but **the two sources still both exist.** The flow below is the target.

**Target — one source by construction (not by coincidence):**

```
OpenBao  cogni/<env>/<service>   (static per-node DB role credentials + DSNs)
   ├─ ESO ─────────────────────────▶ <service>-env-secrets ──▶ pod   (DATABASE_URL / DOLTGRES_URL)
   └─ deploy-infra READS the same value (reader JWT) ──▶ CREATE ROLE …   (set-once)
```

When `deploy-infra` reads each role password from the **same OpenBao value ESO syncs**, the DB role and the pod cannot disagree, no reconcile is ever needed, and the GH-secret DB passwords are retired (Invariant 5: GH env then holds only the seed token + CI-pinned allowlist).

For the static bridge before dynamic DB credentials, each node path carries the
pod-facing DB material explicitly:

```text
cogni/<env>/<node>
  APP_DB_USER
  APP_DB_PASSWORD
  APP_DB_SERVICE_USER
  APP_DB_SERVICE_PASSWORD
  APP_DB_READONLY_USER
  APP_DB_READONLY_PASSWORD
  DATABASE_URL
  DATABASE_SERVICE_URL
  DOLTGRES_URL
  DOLTGRES_PASSWORD
  DOLTGRES_READER_PASSWORD
  DOLTGRES_WRITER_PASSWORD
```

`DATABASE_URL`, `DATABASE_SERVICE_URL`, and `DOLTGRES_URL` may be rendered
from components, but the components they embed are OpenBao-owned.

#### Migration — phased, each phase independently shippable

| Phase | Change                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | State       |

| **0** | **Set-once stabilization** — remove every `.env`→pod-role `ALTER` (#1500/#1502). The precondition: the _source_ of a one-time create can only be swapped cleanly once no per-deploy writer exists.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | **DONE**    |
| **1** | **OpenBao read path on the deploy host** — `deploy-infra.sh` runs on the VM, which runs k3s; OpenBao is a reachable **ClusterIP** there. Mint a short-lived **reader**-role JWT via the _same_ k8s-auth pattern Invariant 13 uses for the writer role (`bao write auth/kubernetes/login role=<env>-db-reader jwt=$(kubectl create token …)`), scoped read-only to **all** DB keys at `cogni/<env>/*` (env-wide — deploy-infra provisions every node on the VM, not one service). `provision-env-vm.sh` Phase 5b adds the `<env>-db-reader` policy + role + `db-provisioner` SA beside `eso-reader`/`<env>-writer`. **No Ingress, no public exposure** — OpenBao stays ClusterIP; reuses the sanctioned k8s-auth seam, not a new entry point (Invariant 9). | **THIS PR** |
| **2** | **Secret materializer owns static DB creds** — `secret-materialize <env> <node>` seeds the static per-node DB credentials above into OpenBao, preserving existing values. `deploy-infra` / the narrow node substrate reconcile render Compose `.env` copies by reading OpenBao via the Phase-1 reader token. `db-provision` stays set-once, but the create-time value now provably equals the OpenBao value. Drop `APP_DB_*_PASSWORD` and `DOLTGRES_*_PASSWORD` runtime dependencies from GH env secrets. The **Grafana datasource** (the readonly role's second consumer, bug.5031 drift class) closes only if `provision-grafana-postgres-datasources.sh` is _also_ pointed at OpenBao.                                                                  | TODO        |
| **3** | **Dynamic-creds endgame** — OpenBao DB secrets engine (per-session creds, `refreshInterval: 15m`); no static role password exists, so there is nothing to drift _or_ rotate. `proj.security-hardening` Crawl row 3; see [`secrets-rotate.md`](../guides/secrets-rotate.md) "Dynamic database credentials".                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | FUTURE      |

**Static bridge decision.** `readonly`, `DOLTGRES_READER`, and
`DOLTGRES_WRITER` must become explicit OpenBao keys in Phase 2. Keeping them as
Compose-local derivations from `POSTGRES_ROOT_PASSWORD` leaves Compose as an
authority for pod-facing material. The long-term destination is still dynamic
DB credentials, but static per-node OpenBao-owned credentials are the right
bridge because they remove split brain now and keep the migration path clean.

**Scope honesty — necessary, not sufficient.** This migration fixes the DB-credential SSOT (root of bug.5002 and the deploy-infra completion-red). It does **not** fix the separate Compose **health-gate** failure mode (a transient `postgres`-unhealthy aborting the whole infra deploy). "3 envs green, repeatable" needs **both** — this design is one of the two.

**Sequencing wrinkle (genesis vs steady-state).** OpenBao is itself a k3s/Argo app stood up _during_ a cold provision, so genesis may use bootstrap inputs to install OpenBao and mint the first writer role. Once that role exists, even genesis should run the same materializer primitive to create OpenBao runtime values before DB role creation. After genesis the GH DB-password secrets are deletable. The new coupling — a deploy now hard-depends on OpenBao being unsealed + reachable — is **not a new SPOF**: OpenBao-down already takes the pods down (ESO is their only DB-cred source), so the deploy path merely shares a dependency the runtime already carries. On an OpenBao read failure `deploy-infra` **fails loud and skips the role create** (db-provision surfaces the real error); it MUST NOT fall back to a divergent GH `.env` value — that is exactly the bug.5002 anti-fix.

**The bug.5002 anti-fix (do NOT do this):** "self-heal drift" by ALTERing a pod-consumed DB role password to deploy-infra's rendered `.env` on every deploy. That makes deploy-infra a **second writer**, guarantees divergence whenever `.env` ≠ OpenBao, and converts a silent inconsistency into an active 502 outage. When `db-provision` can't authenticate, fix the **source** (point it at OpenBao), never overwrite the DB from `.env`.

#### E2E validation contract (Phases 1–2, on candidate-a)

- [ ] **Phase 1 — read path:** on a VM **(re)provisioned with this code**, `deploy-infra`'s read-proof mints the `<env>-db-reader` JWT and lists `cogni/<env>/*` from the deploy context (logged; value never echoed). The role/SA are written by `provision-env-vm.sh`, so a VM provisioned _before_ this PR self-skips the proof with a warning until reprovisioned — **the bug.5002 recovery reprovision lands it for free if this merges first.** Negative (manual): the read-only policy returns 403 on `bao kv patch`.
- [ ] **Phase 2 — sole-source proof (falsifying):** rotate `APP_DB_PASSWORD` in **OpenBao only** (`bao kv patch`, no GH-secret edit), run a deploy. The Postgres role, the pod's `DATABASE_URL`, and the Grafana datasource all converge on the new value with **zero 28P01** and zero GH-secret change.
- [ ] **Phase 2 — dependency-removed proof (negative):** delete the `APP_DB_*_PASSWORD` GH env secrets; a subsequent deploy still succeeds. Proves no GH-secret DB-password dependency remains.
- [ ] **`deploy_verified`:** flight to candidate-a; the deploy's OpenBao reads appear in the audit device → Loki with the `<env>-db-reader` subject.

#### Implementation split

Keep these PRs separate so each one has a falsifiable outcome:

| PR  | Scope                                        | Acceptance                                                                                                                                                                                             |

### Standardized tooling — three entry points, one primitive

All three call the same underlying primitive: `bao kv patch cogni/<env>/<service> <KEY>=<value>` (with appropriate auth method per caller).

#### Entry 1 — CLI (developer; interactive)

```bash
pnpm secrets:set candidate-a node-template OPENAI_API_KEY
# Prompts for value via secure stdin (never echoes)
# Authenticates via OIDC if bao token missing
# Calls: bao kv patch cogni/candidate-a/node-template OPENAI_API_KEY=<value>
```

Wrapper script at `scripts/secrets/set-secret.sh`. Validates path against catalog (`<service>` must exist in `infra/catalog/`); validates env; refuses to write to `cogni/_system/*` (system paths edited by bootstrap only).

#### Entry 2 — GitHub workflow (ops; audit-logged)

`.github/workflows/secret-set.yml` — workflow_dispatch with non-secret inputs:

```yaml
inputs:
  env:
    {
      required: true,
      type: choice,
      options: [candidate-a, preview, production],
    }
  service: { required: true, type: string }
  key: { required: true, type: string }
```

The value is staged separately as a sealed GitHub Environment Secret, read by
the workflow, and immediately patched into OpenBao. It is **not** a workflow
input. Dispatch inputs are visible in run metadata and are therefore forbidden
for values. The workflow authenticates to OpenBao via GitHub Actions OIDC
federation (the `OPENBAO_SEED_TOKEN` per env in GH secrets is NOT used by this
workflow; OIDC issues a job-scoped token with the env writer policy). Audit log
entry generated in OpenBao. Production-env writes require explicit re-approval
through GitHub Environment protection rules.

#### Entry 3 — Operator API (node-owner self-serve; OpenFGA-authorized)

```
POST /api/v1/nodes/<id>/secrets
Body: { env, key, value, op: "set" | "rotate" }   # env is a REQUIRED FLIGHT_ENVS value
Response: 200 { written, version, path }   # path = cogni/<env>/<node>/<KEY>, no value
```

A node-owner granted OpenFGA `secrets_manager` on the node sets/rotates a node-scoped
**A2 value** through the operator holding only an **API key** — no kubeconfig, no
writer JWT. The required `env` field is validated == this operator's own
`DEPLOY_ENVIRONMENT` (else `409 wrong_operator_env`); the path env stays the
operator's own. The operator checks `can_manage_secrets ← secrets_manager`
(per-node, fail-closed: 503 on
`authz_unavailable`, 403 on deny — never owner-fallback), enforces the catalog
allowlist and the OpenBao `_system`/`_shared` policy deny, then writes
`cogni/data/<env>/<node>/<KEY>` with the operator pod's **OWN** in-cluster OpenBao
identity (projected SA token → k8s-auth over ClusterIP). The value transits TLS to
the operator and never leaves it; the node slug is operator-stamped from the
OpenFGA-authorized resource and env is validated against the operator's own.
Per-node isolation is **tuple-based** (OpenFGA), not a shared writer token. **Live
per-env readiness is not snapshotted here** (it drifts) — recall the hub guide
`node-self-serve-secrets` (`GET /api/v1/knowledge/node-self-serve-secrets`). Spec +
roadmap: [`docs/design/node-self-serve-secrets.md`](../design/node-self-serve-secrets.md).

> Supersedes the prior shape-only `secrets/declare` sketch (agent declares shape,
> human fills value). The node-self-serve spike (#1627) deliberately closed that
> human-in-the-loop gap: the authorized caller passes the value over TLS and the
> operator — not a human with a kubeconfig — performs the OpenBao write.

### Value classification — three orthogonal axes

A catalog entry answers three independent questions. Do not conflate them.

**1. `source:` — where the value ORIGINATES (who can produce it):**

| `source:` | Origin                                                                                                                                    | Provisioning behavior                                       |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `agent`   | we generate it (`generate:` field required)                                                                                               | materialize once, preserve on reruns                        |
| `human`   | **un-generatable by us** — vendor-minted; a human supplies it once via the vendor's UI (e.g. a GitHub App **private key**, an OpenAI key) | carry the supplied value from GH env; never regenerate      |
| `derived` | computed from non-secret inputs and OpenBao-owned secret inputs                                                                           | recompute deterministically; never use Compose as authority |

**2. `custody:` — where the value is authoritative:**

| `custody:`    | Use                                                                 |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `openbao`     | runtime secrets, pod-facing DB role material, dual-plane app values |
| `github-env`  | CI-only/bootstrap credentials, sealed staging for `secret-set.yml`  |
| `repo-config` | non-secret config committed through Git/GitOps                      |

`custody` is the security axis. A B-tier Compose value can still have
`custody: openbao` if it provisions a pod-facing role or must agree with a
pod-facing value. In that case Compose receives a rendered copy and owns
nothing.

**3. `consumers:` — where the value is rendered:**

| consumer   | Render path                                            |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `pod`      | OpenBao -> ESO -> k8s Secret -> Deployment `envFrom`   |
| `compose`  | OpenBao read at deploy time or future Bao Agent render |
| `ci`       | OpenBao via OIDC or GH env only when truly CI-only     |
| `external` | Explicit `syncTo` push such as GitHub App webhook sync |

**`syncTo:` (optional) — does the value ALSO live in an external system we must keep in lockstep:**

A value's origin is independent of whether it must be mirrored outward. The GitHub App **webhook secret** is `source: agent` (we generate it) **and** `syncTo: github-app-webhook` (GitHub holds a copy that must byte-match). `syncTo` names the external mirror; provisioning runs the matching push after writing the pod Secret.

| `syncTo:`            | Mirror target                            | Push mechanism                                                                                                                      |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| _(unset)_            | none — value lives only in our substrate | —                                                                                                                                   |
| `github-app-webhook` | the GitHub App's webhook secret          | `scripts/secrets/sync-app-webhook-secret.sh` (App JWT → `PATCH /app/hook/config`), invoked by `deploy-infra` after the Secret write |

**Why the second axis is load-bearing — misclassifying a mirrored secret is a silent-failure bug.** A `source: agent` value with no `syncTo` is regenerated every provision; if it actually must equal an externally-held counterpart, the two never converge, so `deploy-infra` re-writing the pod Secret becomes the _breaking_ path (every webhook fails HMAC verification, logged only as a `level:40` warn). `syncTo` closes the loop: provisioning owns BOTH copies. No human, self-healing — every infra-lever deploy re-converges.

**Routine rotation of a `source: human` value = ZERO PR** (the primary path; a
node owner with a `secrets_manager` grant, holding only an API key):

1. `POST /api/v1/nodes/<id>/secrets { env, key, value, op: "rotate" }` (Entry 3 above)
2. Operator writes `cogni/<env>/<node>/<KEY>` with its own OpenBao identity (OpenBao retains prior version)
3. ESO refresh interval pulls new value into k8s Secret
4. Reloader detects Secret change → restarts pod (zero-downtime; controlled rolling update)
5. Audit log entry in OpenBao + Loki

The break-glass CLI equivalent (`pnpm secrets:set <env> <service> <KEY>`, Entry 1)
runs the same `bao kv patch` primitive but requires kube custody + a writer JWT —
reserved for cross-env writes or genuine break-glass. `source: agent`/`derived`
keys (`AUTH_SECRET`, DB creds, DSNs) are never hand-rotated on either lane; the
substrate re-mints them. (A dedicated `pnpm secrets:rotate` generate-then-write
wrapper is a tracked follow-up under `proj.security-hardening`; today the
primitive is `secrets:set`.) See [`secrets-rotate.md`](../guides/secrets-rotate.md).

**Rollback path:** `bao kv rollback -version=N cogni/<env>/<service>` restores the prior version. Useful for incident response (e.g., rotated key turned out to be invalid).

### RBAC policy templates

OpenBao policies are path-prefix-scoped. Templates (`policies/<role>.hcl`):

```hcl
# poly-production-reader.hcl
path "cogni/data/production/poly/*" { capabilities = ["read"] }
path "cogni/metadata/production/poly/*" { capabilities = ["read", "list"] }

# poly-production-writer.hcl
path "cogni/data/production/poly/*" { capabilities = ["read", "create", "update", "patch"] }
path "cogni/metadata/production/poly/*" { capabilities = ["read", "list"] }
# Deliberately no delete — destroy requires admin escalation per CC6.1
```

Bound via OpenBao role definitions to Kubernetes ServiceAccounts (per-service-per-env), OIDC subjects (developer roles), or operator-mediated agent tokens.

### SOC 2 mapping

| TSC Criterion                          | How this spec satisfies it                                                                                                                                   |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **CC6.1** Logical access controls      | OpenBao policies enforce least-priv per path; Kubernetes auth method per pod; OIDC for humans; operator-mediated tokens for agents                           |
| **CC6.6** Data confidentiality at rest | OpenBao encrypts at rest by default; k8s Secrets stored in etcd (encryption-at-rest enabled by k3s default); pod consumption via kubelet tmpfs (memory only) |
| **CC7.2** Anomaly detection            | OpenBao audit log → Alloy → Loki → alert rules (e.g., production writes from unexpected actors, off-hours rotation, repeated failed access)                  |
| **CC8.1** Change management            | Versioned KV provides immutable audit trail per path; rotation evidenced by audit log entries with actor + timestamp + outcome; rollback path documented     |

### Anti-patterns (reviewer will reject)

- Per-secret `ExternalSecret` resources (one YAML per key) — wrong shape; use `dataFrom: extract` per service-env
- `valueFrom: secretKeyRef` per env var in pod spec (forces pod spec edit per secret) — use `envFrom: secretRef`
- Secret values in committed YAML, even base64-encoded — base64 ≠ encryption
- Bypassing the standardized tooling for production-env writes
- `deploy-infra.sh` / `db-provision` / `doltgres-provision` ALTERing a **pod-consumed** DB role password from a rendered `.env` (a second writer to the OpenBao-owned credential — Invariant 15; caused the candidate-a bug.5002 cluster outage). Roles are created set-once from the OpenBao value, never reconciled to `.env`.
- `bao kv put` (replaces all keys at path) instead of `bao kv patch` (additive)
- `bao kv destroy` to clean up — use `bao kv delete` (soft delete; restorable); only destroy with explicit incident-response justification
- Sealed Secrets (cluster-bound keys; rejected per `proj.security-hardening` Design Notes)
- SOPS encrypted files in git (placeholder scaffold being retired; rejected per same)
- AWS Secrets Manager / 1Password Connect / Doppler as the default backend (vendor lock against OSS-first constraint; forks MAY swap backends via ESO's pluggable provider, but OpenBao is the baseline)

## E2E Validation — the self-serve proof

The model is proven, end to end, by a node dev adding **one throwaway secret to the `node-template`
node** and watching it reach the running pod with zero operator-domain edits. Today `node-template`
has **no** per-node catalog (all its keys live `_shared` in `infra/secrets-catalog.yaml`), so the
probe also exercises the per-node declaration seam for the first time.

**Throwaway probe:** `NODE_TEMPLATE_SELFSERVE_PROBE` — declared in
`nodes/node-template/.cogni/secrets-catalog.yaml`, so `service:` auto-resolves to `node-template`
and it fans out to **only** the node-template pod (not every node). `tier: A2`, `shared: false`,
**`source: agent`** (`generate: { kind: hex, bytes: 16 }`). No app code consumes it; the proof is
that it materializes in the node-template pod's environment.

The probe ships as its **own node-template-scoped PR** (just the one catalog file) — which is itself
the cleanest proof of the model: adding a secret is a single-node-domain PR (`single-node-scope`
passes), with zero operator-domain edits. The substrate that makes it fan out (the emitter, the
`consumedBy` model, the `reconcile-secrets.sh` swap) is the separate operator-domain track.

> **Why `source: agent`, not `human`:** the candidate-a proof must validate
> declaration, materialization, ESO sync, and pod rollout without depending on a
> vendor/human value. Human-sourced values use the separate `secret-set` or
> operator API lane and are a loud precondition before flight/promotion.

**The falsifying "before" (proves the gap is real):**

- [ ] On `main` (pre-`CATALOG_IS_THE_ONE_READER`), add the probe to a new
      `nodes/node-template/.cogni/secrets-catalog.yaml`. The loader sees it
      (`pnpm secrets:set --list` / `print-pod-keys node-template` includes it) but a fresh provision
      does **not** seed it — `bao kv get cogni/<env>/node-template` lacks the key. ⟹ catalog entry is
      inert. This is the bug.

**CI (unit, no infra) — must be green to merge:**

- [ ] `secrets-fanout.test.sh` rewritten: `NODE_BASELINE_KEYS` (and the provision-env / bootstrap key
      sets) **equal** the loader-derived pod-key set per node. RED if a catalog pod-key is dropped.
- [ ] `print-pod-keys` unit: a catalog with `appliesTo: all-nodes` key → present for every node; an
      `appliesTo: payments`/`service: poly` key → present only for poly.
- [ ] Loader/Zod unit: the probe entry parses; `service:` matches parent dir; name unique across catalogs.
- [ ] `shellcheck` on the three de-listed scripts; `pnpm check:docs` for the doc edits.

**Candidate-a (the wire — `deploy_verified`):**

- [ ] Flight this branch → candidate-a; confirm build SHA == head.
- [ ] **Declare** (Atom ①): land the node-template-scoped probe PR (`nodes/node-template/.cogni/secrets-catalog.yaml`).
      `secret-materialize candidate-a node-template` auto-seeds
      `cogni/candidate-a/node-template/NODE_TEMPLATE_SELFSERVE_PROBE` from the
      catalog (`source: agent`) — verify via `bao kv get` (port-forward)
      **with zero per-secret hand-edits and zero `pnpm secrets:set`**. This is
      the catalog-to-OpenBao proof.
- [ ] ESO: the node-template `*-env-secrets` ExternalSecret reports `SecretSynced`; the synced k8s
      Secret contains the probe key.
- [ ] **Reloader closes the loop:** the pod rolling-restarts on the Secret change; `kubectl exec … printenv`
      shows `NODE_TEMPLATE_SELFSERVE_PROBE` in the running container — **no manual rollout**.
- [ ] **Self-serve assertion:** the entire `source: agent` flow touched only
      `nodes/node-template/.cogni/secrets-catalog.yaml` plus the materializer
      runtime — zero edits to `reconcile-secrets.sh`, `provision-env.yml`,
      `bootstrap.sh`, pod specs, or ExternalSecret YAML.

**Regression / negative:**

- [ ] Re-run provision (idempotency): no pod churn for unchanged values.
- [ ] A node that does NOT own a `service`-pinned A2 key still does not receive it (operator vs a poly key).
- [ ] `dolthub_push_ok`: with the same machinery, `DOLTHUB_*`/`DOLT_CREDS_*` now fan out — a knowledge
      contribution merge fires `dolthub_push_ok` in Loki (the original task.5104 goal, now reproducible).

> The actionable, checkable step list lives in the work item (`task.5104`); this section is the
> acceptance contract those steps must satisfy.

## Docs Hygiene

Do not create a parallel secrets-vision doc. The durable contract lives here;
the practical recipes live in `docs/guides/secrets-add-new.md` and
`docs/guides/secrets-rotate.md`; routing details live in
`docs/spec/secrets-classification.md`; node-formation behavior lives in
`docs/design/node-wizard-secret-setting.md`.

Any doc that says "GitHub env is the runtime source of truth", "VM `.env` owns a
pod-facing value", or "candidate-flight accepts secret values" is stale and
must be rewritten or deleted. Link preservation is secondary to purging the old
authority model.

## Acceptance

- ✅ Every invariant cited in this spec has a corresponding enforcement point (test, CI check, OpenBao policy, or operator-app check) once `task.0284` ships
- ✅ Adding a new secret to an existing service-env path requires zero git changes
- ✅ Rotating a secret requires zero git changes
- ✅ Secret values never appear in any committed file, PR diff, GitHub Actions log line, chat transcript, or AI agent context window
- ✅ A node dev adds a `source: agent` secret to their node end-to-end (`NODE_TEMPLATE_SELFSERVE_PROBE` proof) touching only their per-node catalog plus the materializer runtime — no operator-domain edit, no kubectl, no laptop root token
