/**
 * Module: `@features/nodes/launch-pack`
 * Purpose: Build the minimal handoff packet a user's AI assistant needs after
 *   node publish. The wizard stores birth facts; live systems remain the source
 *   of truth for CI, GHCR, flight, and deployed build identity. The assistant
 *   starts with no privileged GitHub access: it DECLARES its GitHub login on the
 *   developer-access request, and the owner's single Approve provisions branch-push
 *   on the node repo for that login (rbac.md §6a) — so it pushes a branch to the
 *   node repo it was handed and opens a SAME-REPO PR (a personal fork-PR is only the
 *   fallback when no login was declared / push wasn't granted). Every privileged
 *   action (run-ci, merge, flight) runs through the operator API gated by the same
 *   owner-granted RBAC tuple — the lone human step.
 * Scope: Pure string/object construction. No IO.
 * Invariants: STARTER_SHELVES_MIRROR_BASE_DOMAIN_SEEDS — `NODE_STARTER_SHELF_IDS`
 *   must equal the ids in `packages/knowledge-base/src/seeds/domains.ts`
 *   (`BASE_DOMAIN_SEEDS`), which is the source of truth. The operator app does not
 *   depend on `@cogni/knowledge-base` (a drizzle schema package), so the list is
 *   mirrored here as prompt text and pinned by `tests/meta/launch-pack-starter-shelves`.
 * Links: node-launch-handoff, api/v1/vcs/{run-ci,merge,flight} routes (#1792, #1801),
 *   knowledge entry `cogni-domain-taxonomy`, task.5196
 * @public
