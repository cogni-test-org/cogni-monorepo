/**
 * Module: `@features/nodes/distribution-setup-state`
 * Purpose: PURE derivation of the node distribution-setup stepper state from per-plane GROUND TRUTH.
 *   The setup spans three planes — (1) the on-chain distributor (deploy → transferOwnership(DAO)),
 *   (2) the git-authoritative activation record (repo-spec on the node's `main`, possibly still an
 *   OPEN activation PR), and (3) the on-chain ONE_TIME_AUTHORIZATION grant. Each step's state is
 *   derived from its own plane's truth, never from optimistic local component state, so a page
 *   refresh re-derives the identical view (story.5004 — the toks3 "reverted to baseline" bug).
 * Scope: Pure functions + types only. No IO, no hooks, no React. The card supplies chain reads
 *   (wagmi) and the record status (GET distributions-status route); this module only folds them.
 * Invariants:
 *   - GROUND_TRUTH_ONLY: inputs are plane truths (spec text on main, open-PR state, chain reads);
 *     outputs are a deterministic fold. Refresh-safe by construction.
 *   - OPEN_PR_IS_FIRST_CLASS: an unmerged activation PR derives `pr_open` — NEVER `not_recorded`.
 *     On-chain-succeeded-but-unrecorded derives `record_incomplete`/`not_recorded` with the
 *     distributor still visible — never hidden.
 *   - ORDERED_STEPS: deploy → authorize → record. The repo-spec cannot say active until both
 *     on-chain planes are verified; an open record PR is terminal and awaits merge.
 * Side-effects: none
 * Links: src/features/nodes/DistributionsCard.client.tsx,
 *   src/app/api/v1/nodes/[id]/distributions-status/route.ts,
 *   docs/spec/tokenomics-distribution.md ("Activation — one guided flow, git-authoritative")
