/**
 * Module: `@features/compute/node-boot-recovery`
 * Purpose: Resolve one (node, environment)'s boot-recovery posture — whether a lease that never
 *   served is held for a human or closed so the bounded re-mint can try another provider.
 * Scope: Pure catalog policy parsing. No workflow, git, provider, or cluster I/O.
 * Invariants:
 *   - HOLD_IS_DEFAULT: an absent row or environment resolves to `hold`, byte-identical to every
 *     row's behaviour before this cell existed. Mirrors ZERO_IS_DEFAULT / LEGACY_IS_DEFAULT.
 *   - RECOVERY_IS_NOT_CALLER_INPUT: only the catalog row selects this (CATALOG_IS_SSOT). A
 *     per-request "is this disposable?" argument is precisely the seam through which a production
 *     workload would eventually be closed by a bad call — see `bootPolicyForEnvironment`.
 *   - ONE_CELL_OPENS_BOTH_GATES: the consumer derives BOTH `onDeadline` and `onGiveUp` from this
 *     single value. `Replace` paired with `onDeadline: Hold` would hold a dead lease forever while
 *     advertising self-healing, which is worse than honest `Hold`, so the two are never
 *     independently settable.
 *   - BOUNDED_BY_THE_COMPOSITION: `auto` authorizes at most 3 `:recover:<n>` attempts per
 *     generation; exhaustion still parks the workload for a human. This never becomes an
 *     unbounded paid retry loop.
 * Side-effects: none
 * Links: story.5050, bug.5325, task.5153 (actuator-owned provider strikes — the prerequisite that
 *   made `Replace` admissible), infra/catalog/_schema.json (`boot_recovery`),
 *   infra/crossplane/xcomputeworkload/composition.yaml (the `:recover:<n>` path this unlocks),
 *   ./compute-workload-manifest (`bootPolicyForEnvironment`)
 * @internal

/**
 * Resolve one environment's boot-recovery posture, defaulting to `hold`.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. Before it, a provider that won a bid and then failed to serve left the lane
 * stalled until a human noticed, diagnosed, closed the lease and bumped `lease_generation` — one
 * manual cycle per defective provider. With a placement requirement narrowing the pool to a
 * handful of providers, a single bad one could stall a production lane indefinitely while billing
 * (bug.5325). `auto` lets the platform walk its own allowlist instead: close, strike, re-mint
 * elsewhere, bounded at three attempts.

  // single provider that wins a bid and then fails to serve stalls the lane until a human
  // intervenes (bug.5325 — eight consecutive auctions on poly). `hold` is the right default for an
  // unconstrained row, where the marketplace is wide and a failure is genuinely an incident worth
  // preserving. It is the WRONG default for a constrained one, where holding is the trap.
  //
  // So the posture is DERIVED from the constraint instead of demanding a second, separate opt-in
  // that a node could forget — and forgetting it is indistinguishable from the bug it prevents.
  // An explicit cell still wins, so a constrained row can opt back into `hold` for forensics.
