/**
 * Module: `@features/compute/node-lease-generation`
 * Purpose: Resolve one (node, environment)'s explicit Akash lease replacement counter.
 * Scope: Pure catalog policy parsing. No workflow, git, provider, or cluster I/O.
 * Invariants:
 *   - ZERO_IS_DEFAULT: an absent cell resolves to 0, the same value the Composition fallback
 *     uses when neither migration wire field exists. Mirrors LEGACY_IS_DEFAULT.
 *   - NOTHING_BUMPS_IMPLICITLY: the generation is the ONLY varying component of the actuator's
 *     wallet-wide idempotence key (`xcw:<namespace>:<name>:<generation>`). This resolver READS a
 *     human-committed catalog cell and never derives, increments, or synthesizes a value —
 *     a generation that moved on its own would answer "no existing resource" after a promote
 *     and mint a SECOND PAID LEASE.
 *   - GENERATION_IS_NOT_CALLER_INPUT: REST callers never select a generation; only the catalog row does.
 * Side-effects: none
 * Links: story.5016, infra/catalog/_schema.json,
 *   infra/crossplane/xcomputeworkload/xrd.yaml (spec.leaseGeneration)
 * @internal

/**
 * Resolve one env's lease replacement generation. Missing policy is deliberately 0 — the value
 * every non-replaced workload already runs under and the Composition fallback uses — so this
 * field is inert for every row that has never needed a lease replaced.
 *
 * This is the caller-side half of the actuator's settled-key refusal
 * (`akash_tx_create_refused_settled_key`): once a lease closes terminally its idempotence
 * key is spent forever, so recreating that (node, environment) REQUIRES a bumped generation, and
 * the bump must be an explicit human commit to the catalog row — never automation.
