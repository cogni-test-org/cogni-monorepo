/**
 * Module: `@features/compute/akash-tx/akash-tx-actuator`
 * Purpose: The Akash transaction actuator — the irreducible, Cogni-specific boundary where a
 *   logical workload becomes a PAID Akash lease. Owns wallet-global serialization, the durable
 *   pre-transaction receipt, post-response-loss recovery, and the typed workload contract.
 *   Extracted from the ComputeWorkload controller so Crossplane can own everything generic
 *   (task.5095, story.5016 R2.2).
 * Scope: Four bounded logical operations (observe/create/update/delete) over one Console
 *   client + one durable ledger. Does NOT watch, poll to convergence, retry, back off, hold
 *   finalizers, elect a leader, or reconcile — every one of those is Crossplane's job and
 *   their absence here is the point.
 * Invariants:
 *   - ONE_ATTEMPT_PER_CALL: each method performs at most one provider transaction. A caller
 *     that wants a second attempt makes a second call.
 *   - RECEIPT_BEFORE_TRANSACTION: the pre-POST cursor is durable before any Console POST, so a
 *     lost response leaves recoverable evidence rather than an orphan paid lease.
 *   - IDENTITY_BEFORE_TRANSACTION: the SAME receipt binds {nodeId, environment, composite
 *     uid/generation, cogniKey}, and it is bound by the claiming INSERT — before the allocation
 *     cursor is even read, let alone posted. Identity arrives EXPLICITLY on the wire from the
 *     Composition; this actuator never parses it out of the key, the slug, or the credential
 *     (task.5103). A key whose receipt binds a different node is refused, never re-bound:
 *     mis-attributed spend is unrecoverable in a way a retry is not.
 *   - WALLET_SINGLE_WRITER: the ledger slot is held for exactly the unrecoverable window
 *     (cursor read → allocated handle durable) and is ACCOUNT-wide, never per-workload — the
 *     scope is `akash-console:<account id>` since bug.5187, so one Console account is one slot
 *     however many environments this writer mints for. The account's sole writer is this
 *     actuator; its legacy controller is absent and Console/manual writes are forbidden.
 *     candidate-a holds the managed test account and production a dedicated one; preview hosts
 *     no writer (ci-cd.md Axiom 26).
 *   - FAIL_CLOSED_BUT_RECOVERABLE: an allocation that cannot be resolved to exactly one LIVE
 *     lease raises allocation_ambiguous and is NEVER healed by a fresh create. An allocation
 *     PROVEN not to be billing — no live deployment beyond its baseline, or a create that
 *     closed its own deployment and re-read the closure — settles its own receipt
 *     (`allocation_rolled_back`), releases the wallet slot, and is retryable under the SAME
 *     key. bug.5192: collapsing those two cases into one un-exitable refusal turned a single
 *     crashed create into a 33h account-wide create outage. Fail-closed means "never spend
 *     blind"; it must not mean "never recover".
 *   - CLOSE_VERIFY_THEN_CLEAR: a receipt is only ever settled against positive evidence — no
 *     cursor (durably pre-transaction), a Console read-back showing `closed`, or a wallet scan
 *     showing nothing live beyond the baseline. Never on a timer (bug.5189).
 *   - MIGRATION_IS_NOT_A_PAYMENT_PRECONDITION: NO mutating call states, proves, or can be
 *     refused by a migration. bug.5140 made a completed per-digest DB migration a precondition
 *     of every paid transaction; task.5135 severed that. Node toks5 is the proof it was wrong:
 *     a valid XR in `cogni-production` with a valid image digest whose migration never ran, so
 *     this actuator was NEVER CALLED, `akash-lease` reported "not yet ready" 1044 times, and
 *     the node never existed in any environment — silent, unbounded, no alarm. The migration is
 *     now a RELEASE step attached to `observe` (unpaid, no wallet slot, no Console POST), and
 *     its phase is REPORTED on the observation. A workload whose schema is bad or missing
 *     therefore gets its lease and fails READINESS against the composite's boot SLO — loud and
 *     bounded — which is what bug.5116 actually needed. The paid path consequently needs no
 *     database-adjacent capability at all.
 *   - IDENTICAL_SDL_IS_A_NO_OP (bug.5238): `update` PUTs the SDL only when it hashes differently
 *     from the last one applied (persisted on the receipt). A PUT is idempotent for the
 *     escrow/handle but re-triggers a provider redeploy every time, so re-PUTting a byte-
 *     identical SDL thrashes a not-yet-serving node; the gate skips only that case and any real
 *     spec change still applies + records the new hash.
 *   - REFUSAL_IS_OBSERVABLE: every refusal emits a structured log line before it throws
 *     (bug.5115: a wallet block that only reached CR status was invisible for hours).
 * Side-effects: IO (Akash Console transactions via the injected client; durable allocation and
 *   receipt-linked cost writes; one bounded serving probe per observe when asked)
 * Links: @ports/akash-tx.port, adapters/server/compute/akash-compute.adapter (SDL + provider
 *   screening stay there), adapters/server/compute/akash-tx-allocation-ledger.adapter,
 *   ./akash-tx-wallet, ./akash-tx-http, task.5095
