/**
 * Module: `@features/compute/akash-tx/akash-tx-migration-step`
 * Purpose: Run the per-bundle-digest database migration as a RELEASE step on the actuator's
 *   UNPAID observe tick, and REPORT its phase. Replaces the pre-transaction gate this module
 *   used to be (task.5135): bug.5116 wanted a fresh node's schemas to exist, and bug.5140
 *   implemented that want as a precondition of every paid Akash transaction. That coupling is
 *   what left node toks5 with a valid XR, a valid image digest, and no lease in ANY
 *   environment — `akash-lease` said "not yet ready" 1044 times while the actuator was never
 *   called at all. Buying compute and migrating a database are different jobs; this one is no
 *   longer allowed to stop the other.
 * Scope: One bounded, NON-THROWING attempt per call: translate the caller's step into the
 *   per-digest migration contract, ask the migration port once, answer with a phase. Does NOT
 *   watch, poll, sleep, retry, hold state, or refuse anything — the caller (Crossplane, via the
 *   actuator's observe) owns requeue and backoff exactly as it does for every other tick.
 * Invariants:
 *   - NEVER_REFUSES: there is no failure path that throws. Every outcome — including an
 *     unreachable prover and a missing capability — is a PHASE. A thrown error here would
 *     re-create the coupling this module was rewritten to delete, because observe is the call
 *     Crossplane uses to decide whether to create the lease at all.
 *   - COMMANDS_ARE_NOT_CALLER_SUPPLIED: the migration commands live here, keyed by
 *     runtimeProfile. A caller-supplied command would let anyone who can reach the actuator run
 *     an arbitrary container against the environment's database under its service account.
 *   - ENVIRONMENT_IS_THE_WORKLOAD'S: the Job is ensured against the secret AND THE NAMESPACE of
 *     the workload being reconciled — both stated here, from the environment the observe request
 *     carries. "Which environment's database?" is answered by WHERE THE WORKLOAD IS, never by who
 *     is paying for it. Until task.5132 only the secret NAME was stated; the namespace defaulted
 *     to this process's own, which for a foreign-custodied lane resolved that name to the PAYING
 *     env's Secret — and left the receipt where the lane then read it as its own proof.
 *   - OUTCOME_IS_OBSERVABLE: every phase emits a structured log marker before it is returned
 *     (bug.5115: a refusal that only reached CR status was invisible for hours). A `failed`
 *     phase additionally reaches the composite as a named status reason.
 * Side-effects: IO (one migration-proof call per invocation; the Kubernetes adapter behind the
 *   port creates the per-digest Job on first ask and reads it thereafter)
 * Links: @ports/akash-tx.port, @ports/compute-workload-migration.port,
 *   adapters/server/compute/kubernetes-migration-job.adapter, bug.5116, bug.5140, task.5135
 * @internal

/**
 * Migration command policy implied by the `cogni-node-app-v1` runtime profile (bug.5116).
 * Fork images bundle the migrator at `/app/app/...` — the same contract the k3s lane's
 * `migrate` initContainer exercises against the monorepo layout.
 *
 * TWINS, kept byte-identical on purpose: `cogniNodeAppMigrationPhases()` in the frozen
 * `compute-workload-reconciler`, and this. The controller is frozen (no new capabilities, see
 * docs/spec/cicd-platform-boundary.md), so the policy is restated here rather than moved out
 * of it; the test pins the exact strings so a change to either is a deliberate, reviewed diff.
