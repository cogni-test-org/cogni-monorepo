/**
 * Module: `@features/compute/lease-reactivation` (test)
 * Purpose: Pin `requiredLeaseGeneration` — the fresh/terminal/live/preparing matrix (task.5132).
 *   TERMINAL receipts (`released`/`failed`) force the next generation past themselves; a LIVE
 *   `allocated` receipt pins the derived generation AT its own (never past it); `preparing`
 *   proves nothing.
 * Side-effects: none
