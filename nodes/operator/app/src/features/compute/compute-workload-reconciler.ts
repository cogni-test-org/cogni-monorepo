/**
 * Level-based reconciliation for one provider-neutral ComputeWorkload resource.
 *
 * Invariants (migrated here from the retired `node-workload-spec.ts`, whose parallel
 * spec-builder was dead code — this reconciler is the live authority, task.5115):
 *   - APP_ONLY_NO_INFRA_ON_DECENTRALIZED_COMPUTE (Derek, 2026-08-31): a workload is the
 *     node-app container ONLY. Databases, Temporal, Redis and LiteLLM stay on the Cherry
 *     substrate; running them as workload sidecars is the rejected anti-pattern.
 *   - SHARED_STATE: workloads dial the env's real per-node DSNs, so they run no migrations
 *     and share state with the k8s deployment of the same node.
 *   - SCOPED_CREDS_ONLY: callers pass node-scoped, budget-capped credentials (per-node DB
 *     roles, LiteLLM virtual key, write-only Loki key) — never a master/fleet secret.
 *   - Workload sizing is owned by `packages/repo-spec/src/node-app-deployment.ts`
 *     (`COGNI_NODE_APP_V1_SERVICE.resources`), never redefined here.

 * epoch; a non-live epoch therefore proves the claimant process is gone and can
 * never settle its own outcome, while blind same-key replay only burns the
 * mutation budget into a terminal RetryLimitExceeded loop. Fail closed (Axiom
 * 26): observe the dead attempt's durable trace — its wallet slot — before any
 * new mutation. A persisted cursor means provider I/O may have happened, so the
 * only legal move is the existing adopt-or-hold observation path; no cursor
 * anywhere proves the pre-POST baseline was never written, so the abandoned slot
 * is settled and the exhausted key escalates through the bounded recovery
 * ladder. Callers must never route a live-epoch claim here — a concurrent
 * in-process attempt stays blocked.
 *
 * Deliberate tradeoff: every dead-epoch interruption of a claim consumes one
 * recovery ordinal, so MAX_RECOVERY_ATTEMPTS mid-claim process deaths within a
 * single generation end in RecoveryLimitExceeded. Bounded-and-visible beats an
 * unbounded replay loop; a fleet restarting that often has a bigger problem.
