   * bug.5063: this lookup sits on the interactive auth path, in front of a human, and
   * the catalog read is an App JWT exchange plus a fetch per catalog file — measured
   * at 11.0s cold against 0.22s warm on candidate-a. A human reads 11s as broken; they
   * said so.
   *
   * The projection is safe to lead with. `identity-model.md` fixes `nodes.id` AS the
   * repo-spec `node_id` — not a surrogate — so the row is keyed by the same identity the
   * request names, and `deploy_envs` is the same list the allowlist needs.
   * `catalog-registry-reconcile` re-reads merged git on a ten-minute poll, so staleness
   * is bounded by that interval rather than unbounded.
   *
   * The fallback is what makes leading with it correct: a node registered within the
   * last poll window is missing from the projection, and would otherwise be rejected as
   * `unknown_node` — a fail-CLOSED error, but the wrong one. On a miss we pay the slow
   * read once rather than lie about the node not existing.
