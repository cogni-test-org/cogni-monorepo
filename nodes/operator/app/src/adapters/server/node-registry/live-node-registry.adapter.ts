/**
 * Module: `@adapters/server/node-registry/live-node-registry.adapter`
 * Purpose: The IDENTITY + HEALTH decorator for the public gallery — a NodeRegistryPort decorator that
 *   wraps an inner registry (the bundled-catalog ∪ DB projection skeleton) and ENRICHES each node with
 *   its self-described identity (hook, mission, thumbnail, brandColor) and liveness
 *   (live/down), read from a CACHED per-slug probe. The operator holds ZERO per-node identity literals:
 *   every gallery card's display data comes from the node's OWN well-known projection, merged here.
 *   Decision: down nodes are NOT hidden — the operator OWNS displaying health, so a decommissioned node
 *   reads `down` honestly rather than vanishing.
 * Scope: Pure composition over an injected `getLiveness` (the cached rollup) + the inner port. No IO of
 *   its own — the probing + its TTL cache are wired at bootstrap and injected as a closure.
 * Invariants:
 *   - NEVER_PROBES_ON_RENDER: `getLiveness` is the cached snapshot accessor; this adapter NEVER probes
 *     inline. The homepage (highest-traffic public page) pays at most a cache lookup.
 *   - IDENTITY_OVERWRITES_SKELETON: when a node projects identity, its hook/mission/brand enrich the
 *     skeleton's titleCase(slug)/empty fallbacks. A node with no identity keeps the fallbacks (clean
 *     degradation until forks project identity).
 *   - ROSTER_NOT_FILTERED: output is the full inner roster, each annotated with `health`. Nothing is
 *     dropped — honesty is shown, not hidden.
 *   - DEGRADE_TO_INNER: if the cached accessor itself throws (cold-cache total failure), fall back to the
 *     inner list unannotated so a transient infra blip never blanks the homepage; the next refresh heals.
 * Side-effects: none here (IO is in the injected accessor).
 * Links: src/ports/node-registry.port.ts, src/adapters/server/node-registry/prod-liveness.ts,
 *   src/shared/cache/ttl-single-flight.ts, src/bootstrap/container.ts (resolveNodeRegistry)
 * @public
