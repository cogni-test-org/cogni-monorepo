/**
 * Module: `@adapters/server/node-registry/db-node-registry.adapter`
 * Purpose: NodeRegistryPort adapter projecting publicly-listed nodes from the operator `nodes` table.
 *   This is what makes wizard- and submodule-born nodes discoverable: their app tree is absent from
 *   the operator image (never fs-discoverable), but their row is always in the DB — so the table is
 *   the only viable projection.
 * Scope: Reads the live registry via an injected `listListedNodes` reader (service-role, non-RLS) and
 *   maps slug → NodeSummary by the catalog host convention. Degrades to [] on read failure so the
 *   homepage never breaks.
 * Invariants: PUBLIC_READ_IS_SEPARATE — the reader is service-role, never owner-scoped. `kind` is
 *   `full-app` (deployed homepage); hrefs derive from slug. No thumbnail → tile placeholder.
 * Side-effects: none here (IO is in the injected reader).
 * Links: src/ports/node-registry.port.ts, src/shared/node-registry/resolve.ts, src/shared/db/nodes.ts
 * @public
