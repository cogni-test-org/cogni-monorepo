/**
 * Module: `@adapters/server/compute/akash-provider-screen`
 * Purpose: Pure bid-screening + provider-blacklist logic for the Akash provider quality
 *   mandate (task.5051): quality-filter bids on Console provider data, exclude implausibly
 *   cheap outliers, derive blacklist state from outcome history, and rank the survivors.
 * Scope: Pure functions over already-fetched data. Does NOT call the Console API, read the
 *   DB, or know about dseqs/leases (adapter's job) — separated so every transition is unit
 *   testable without IO.
 * Invariants:
 *   - AUDITED_ONLY: with provider metadata available, a bid survives only if its provider is
 *     audited + valid-version + online + uptime7d > 0.95.
 *   - A_BID_IS_NOT_A_POPULARITY_CONTEST (bug.5334): `activeLeases > 0` was part of the
 *     conjunction above as "proof of registry egress". It is a popularity proxy, and no
 *     provider without an existing tenant can satisfy it — so a provider's FIRST lease with
 *     us was unwinnable. That cold-start trap, not jurisdiction and not the provider pool, is
 *     what refused poly's gen-18: `akash.rhite.co.uk` bid 9.14 from a permitted country
 *     reading audited=true, validVersion=true, online=true, uptime7d=0.967,
 *     featEndpointCustomDomain=true, leaseCount=0. The original justification was real
 *     (froggy-servers failed 3/3 leases at "100%" uptime, because marketplace uptime measures
 *     the status port, not workload success) but the remedy was wrong: that evidence is OUR
 *     OWN boot history, and it is already enforced by BLACKLIST_IS_DERIVED below. Screening on
 *     someone else's tenancy count punished newcomers instead of failures.
 *   - DECLARED_INCAPACITY_IS_NOT_A_GAMBLE (bug.5325): `featEndpointCustomDomain` is OPTIONAL on
 *     Akash and several audited, online, quality-passing providers publish `false`. When the
 *     workload serves a custom hostname, a provider declaring `false` is refused — it would
 *     otherwise win on price (the final tiebreak), take a paid lease, and never answer the
 *     public host. UNKNOWN_IS_NOT_NO: only a positive `false` refuses, so one failed
 *     marketplace read cannot dry an auction fleet-wide.
 *   - FAIL_OPEN_ON_MISSING_METADATA: an empty provider map (Console read failed) skips the
 *     metadata filter — the SDL `signedBy` audit anchor remains the hard gate on-chain.
 *   - REQUIRED_FAILS_CLOSED: `requiredCountryCodes` is the one input that INVERTS the rule
 *     above. A PREFERENCE may fail open; a REQUIREMENT may not. When the set is non-empty, a
 *     bid survives only if its provider's country is KNOWN and in the set — unavailable
 *     metadata or an unknown country REFUSES the bid, because a requirement that cannot be
 *     evaluated is not satisfied (story.5050).
 *   - REQUIRED_IS_A_POOL_NARROWER_NOT_A_PROOF: the country compared is the provider's
 *     advertised/INGRESS identity, which is measurably not the EGRESS identity its workload
 *     presents to a third party — two providers in two advertised countries have shared one
 *     egress NAT. Only the workload's own outbound probe proves reachability.
 *   - EVERY_REJECTION_IS_COUNTED: screening returns per-reason counts alongside the survivors.
 *     Three independent filters can each empty the bid set, and an empty set previously
 *     surfaced as one static string after the full bid window (the `d69e5c29` class), so the
 *     caller must be able to say WHICH filter refused everything.
 *   - PRICE_IS_TIEBREAK_NEVER_CRITERION: cheapest WITHIN the screened set; bids ~2σ below
 *     the median price are excluded (absurd underbids are a negative signal, the classic
 *     underbidding-zombie tell).
 *   - BLACKLIST_IS_DERIVED: 24h TTL per SLO failure, permanent at 3 strikes — computed from
 *     append-only outcome history, cleared by deleting rows (never stored state).
 *   - PIN_IS_A_PREFERENCE_NOT_A_GATE (story.5050): `allowedProviders` is an OPTIONAL PIN, not
 *     the authorization boundary. `undefined` AND the EMPTY set both mean "no pin — screen on
 *     policy alone"; ONLY a non-empty set narrows the pool. This deliberately INVERTS the
 *     original fail-closed reading, under which an empty list refused every bid. The reason
 *     is that a hand-maintained address enumeration is not a gate, it is a snapshot that
 *     rots: measured against the live registry on 2026-09-30, only 6 of the 11 pinned
 *     addresses could still win a bid at all — three declare `featEndpointCustomDomain=false`
 *     and two were offline — and the pin, not the Akash market, is what held one node to a
 *     single vendor across ten dry auctions. The boundary that matters is the conjunction of
 *     gates that each fire on their own merits: the on-chain `signedBy` audit anchor asserted
 *     in the SDL, the node catalog's fail-closed `requiredCountryCodes`, `passesQualityFilter`
 *     (which subsumes `isAudited`), the price-outlier exclusion, and the derived strike
 *     blacklist. Removing the pin removes NONE of those.
 * Side-effects: none (pure)
 * Links: ./akash-compute.adapter (caller), ./provider-outcome-store (history source),
 *   knowledge hub `akash-provider-quality-mandate`, task.5051, task.5049 (DEV2 findings)

 * Prefer the declaration. The GeoIP field is wrong in the field and wrong in a way that is

 * registers after today, with no human edit.
