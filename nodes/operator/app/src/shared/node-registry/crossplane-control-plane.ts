/**
 * Module: `@shared/node-registry/crossplane-control-plane`
 * Purpose: CROSSPLANE_IS_INSTALLED_PER_ENVIRONMENT — the ONE enumeration of the deploy
 *   environments whose Argo control plane actually installs Crossplane (core chart, pinned
 *   packages, the `XComputeWorkload` XRD + Composition, and the credential-free
 *   ClusterProviderConfig). task.5097 added production; task.5129 completes preview.
 * Scope: A static fact about the deploy substrate, expressed as data. No I/O, no env read, no
 *   cluster contact — the fact is asserted against git by `tests/ci-invariants/
 *   crossplane-dormant-substrate.spec.ts`, which fails CI the moment this list and the
 *   installed reality disagree in either direction.
 * Invariants:
 *   - AUTHORITY_REQUIRES_AN_INSTALLED_API: naming `crossplane` for an environment that has no
 *     control plane renders an `XComputeWorkload` into a namespace where that CRD does not
 *     exist. The workload is then reconciled by NOBODY and the node never comes up.
 *   - NO_SILENT_DOWNGRADE: consumers must FAIL rather than degrade such a row to `legacy`. The
 *     two authorities mint Akash leases under deliberately disjoint idempotence keys
 *     (`<ns>:<name>:<uid>:<gen>:<op>:<ord>` vs `xcw:<ns>:<name>:<epoch>`), so a quiet fallback
 *     buys a SECOND PAID LEASE instead of colliding safely.
 *   - INSTALLED_IS_NOT_FUNDED: an installed control plane can RECONCILE a composite; only an
 *     actuator WRITER can PAY for one. They are separate facts with separate constants, because
 *     widening the first without the second is exactly the inert staging task.5097 wanted and
 *     conflating them would have flipped every new node's birth row on merge.
 *   - ACCOUNT_TO_WRITER_IS_INJECTIVE, WRITER_TO_ENVS_IS_NOT (bug.5187): the funding fact is a
 *     `writerFor(env) -> cluster/writer` MAP, not a set of environments. One Console account may
 *     back at most one writer — two writers on one account are two independent ledgers against
 *     one escrow — but one writer may legitimately mint for many environments, which is exactly
 *     what the north star (one production account bills every node in every environment)
 *     requires. Stating this as "account -> at most one environment" was a proxy that has since
 *     become a prohibition on the target design.
 * Why shared, not `@features/compute`: both the catalog policy resolver (features) and the
 *   node-formation catalog generator (`@shared/node-app-scaffold/gens/catalog`) must agree on
 *   this set, and `shared` may not import `features` (.dependency-cruiser.cjs `not-in-allowed`).
 *   Same shape as `NODE_DEPLOYMENT_PROVIDERS` in `./placement`, for the same reason.
 * Side-effects: none (pure)
 * Links: infra/k8s/argocd/control-plane/{candidate-a,preview,production}/,
 *   infra/crossplane/xcomputeworkload/, infra/k8s/overlays/<env>/operator/kustomization.yaml,

/**

 * task.5094/task.5096 installed it on candidate-a alone (CANDIDATE_FIRST); task.5097 staged the

 * committing its
 * `infra/k8s/argocd/control-plane/<env>/crossplane-xcomputeworkload-application.yaml`

 *
 * WIDENING THIS LIST ACTIVATES NOTHING. It states where a composite COULD be reconciled, not
 * where one IS: the selector is the per-row `compute_api.<env>` cell in `infra/catalog/*.yaml`,
 * and `resolveNodeComputeApi` resolves an absent cell to `legacy` (LEGACY_IS_DEFAULT). Every
 * fleet row omits the cell, so every fleet row is untouched by this constant's value.

/**
 * ONE actuator WRITER — the reviewed `writerFor(env) -> cluster/writer` map.
 *
 * WHY A WRITER AND NOT AN ENVIRONMENT (bug.5187). The property that keeps money safe is
 * `account -> at most one WRITER`, because the serializer
 * (`akash_tx_allocations_single_writer_idx`) is a per-database partial unique index: two writers
 * on one Console account with two Postgres ledgers cannot see each other, so a retry can pay
 * twice. `account -> at most one ENVIRONMENT` was a usable PROXY only while every writer served
 * exactly its own environment. It is not the property, and under the north star — one production
 * account bills every real node in EVERY environment — it actively forbids the target design.
 *
 * So the mapping is stated explicitly, with the two halves kept apart:
 *   - `writer -> envs` is DELIBERATELY ONE-TO-MANY. A lease is minted off-cluster against
 *     `console-api.akash.network`, so the writer's cluster is independent of where the workload
 *     runs, and one writer may legitimately mint for test, preview and production alike.
 *   - `account -> writer` must stay INJECTIVE. Two writers reaching one account is the
 *     double-spend shape, whichever environments they serve.
 *
 * `cluster` is the environment whose cluster runs the writer Deployment, and therefore the
 * environment whose overlay pins the account and whose ExternalSecret carries the Console key.
 * `serves` is the set of environments whose leases it mints. Today each writer serves only its
 * own cluster — widening a `serves` list IS the north-star cutover, and it is a reviewed edit
 * here rather than an emergent consequence of an overlay change.
 *
 * `tests/ci-invariants/crossplane-dormant-substrate.spec.ts` asserts every half of this against
 * git: one account per writer, one Console-key remoteRef per account, and exactly one writer for
 * every environment whose catalog rows select `compute_api: crossplane`.
