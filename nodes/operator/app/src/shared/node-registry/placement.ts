/**
 * Module: `@shared/node-registry/placement`
 * Purpose: PLACEMENT_DECIDES_THE_ADDRESS — one pure mapping from a node's DECLARED deployment
 *   provider to the base URL the operator dials for that node's app. The operator is
 *   cluster-resident, so it can only use in-cluster Service DNS for a node that is also in the
 *   cluster; a node placed on decentralized compute has no `<slug>-node-app` Service and must be
 *   dialed at the public host it actually serves (bug.5106, story.5016).
 * Scope: Address math only. No I/O, no env read, no DB — callers supply the resolved placement,
 *   this environment's deploy env, and the operator's own apex domain.
 * Invariants:
 *   - K3S_IS_DEFAULT: an absent per-env declaration keeps the existing in-cluster lane, byte-for-byte
 *     the same default as `resolveNodeDeploymentProvider()` and `deployment_provider_for_target()`
 *     (scripts/ci/lib/image-tags.sh). Adding a node never requires a placement edit.
 *   - PLACEMENT_IS_NOT_A_SECOND_LIST: there is no "the akash nodes" enumeration anywhere in operator
 *     code. Placement is DECLARED DATA (`infra/catalog/<slug>.yaml` `deployment_provider.<env>`,
 *     projected into the node registry), never a node name in a branch.
 *   - OFF_CLUSTER_ADDRESS_IS_THE_PUBLIC_HOST: an off-cluster node is reached at the SAME host its
 *     ComputeWorkload publishes — `hostForEnv` over the env's ROOT domain — so there is one host
 *     convention for DNS, the workload's ingress, liveness probes, and this resolution.
 *   - FAIL_LOUD_WITHOUT_A_DOMAIN: an off-cluster node with no resolvable base domain throws. Falling
 *     back to in-cluster DNS would silently reproduce the ENOTFOUND this module exists to remove.
 * Side-effects: none (pure)
 * Links: src/shared/node-registry/deploy-hosts.ts (hostForEnv/rootDomain), src/shared/node-registry/resolve.ts
 *   (internalNodeAppUrl), src/features/compute/node-deployment-provider.ts (the catalog policy twin),
 *   scripts/ci/lib/image-tags.sh (node_app_url_for_target — the CI twin), bug.5106, bug.5094
 * @public

 * reconciles it. k3s rows genuinely run IN their env's cluster and stay there — and because an
