/**
 * Module: `@shared/node-app-scaffold/gens/catalog`
 * Purpose: Pure port of `scaffold-node.sh` step 4 — render a new node's `infra/catalog/<slug>.yaml`
 *   from the `node-template.yaml` shape, so the operator can author a node-formation PR without bash/sed.
 * Scope: Given a `slug` + container `port` + `node_port`, emit a `type:node` catalog entry valid per
 *   `infra/catalog/_schema.json`, with all `node-template`-derived fields renamed to `slug`.
 * Invariants: REPO_SPEC_IS_IDENTITY_SSOT — `.cogni/repo-spec.yaml` is the identity source. A
 *   submodule node's repo-spec is unreadable from the parent at render time, so the catalog carries a
 *   drift-gated `node_id` PROJECTION (verify-scheduler-endpoints asserts it == repo-spec). The mint
 *   generates both from one node_id, so they cannot drift at birth. CATALOG_IS_SSOT — fields mirror
 *   the committed shape.
 * Side-effects: none — pure string transform, no IO, no env.
 * Links: infra/catalog/node-template.yaml, infra/catalog/_schema.json, scripts/setup/scaffold-node.sh,
 *   task.5092, story.5025, task.5097, task.5104
