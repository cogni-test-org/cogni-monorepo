/**
 * Module: `@shared/node-app-scaffold/gens/env-membership-plan`
 * Purpose: Pure delta-planner for the node env-membership verb (story.5020 W4). Given a node's CURRENT
 *   committed control-plane files + a requested `{env, present}` mutation, return the exact set of file
 *   upserts/deletes the operator must commit — WITHOUT touching GitHub. The adapter
 *   ({@link GitHubRepoWriter.openNodeEnvPr}) turns each `upsert` into a blob + each `delete` into a
 *   `sha:null` tree entry; this module owns ALL the add/remove branching so it is unit-testable without
 *   Octokit.
 * Scope: Composes the byte-exact single-file gens (`setCatalogEnvs`, `renderOverlay`, `renderNodeAppset`,
 *   `insert/removeFromAppsetsKustomization`) over the current contents the adapter fetches on main. NO IO,
 *   NO env, NO blob SHAs — the adapter resolves those.
 * Invariants:
 *   - NONEMPTY_DEPLOY_SET — removing an env drops just that env, but removing the final env is rejected;
 *     full decommission is a separate lifecycle operation.
 *   - ACTIVITY_AUTHORITY_STAYS_DEPLOYED — removing the current `activity_env` is rejected. V1 does not
 *     claim an atomic cross-environment authority transfer; that needs a future fenced protocol.
 *   - ACTIVITY_FOLLOWS_INGEST — a promotion carries the activity authority with it: `activity_env`
 *     becomes the highest env the node will be deployed to. Webhooks reach production ONLY, and the
 *     receiving operator routes a repo only when `activityEnv === DEPLOY_ENVIRONMENT`, so a promoted
 *     node that keeps a lower authority can never earn a receipt (bug.5079).
 *
 *     WHY THIS IS SAFE WITHOUT THE DEFERRED FENCED CUTOVER: the protocol was deferred because moving
 *     authority could strand a ledger. It cannot here — production is the only env that can ingest a
 *     Git receipt, so any authority BELOW production has an empty Git ledger by construction. There is
 *     nothing to strand. This reasoning is load-bearing: if webhooks are ever delivered to more than
 *     one environment, this move stops being safe and the fenced protocol becomes required. Removing
 *     the active authority stays rejected (ACTIVITY_AUTHORITY_STAYS_DEPLOYED) — that direction CAN
 *     strand a production ledger, and this change does not touch it.
 *
 *     Known cosmetic residue: a node may hold an empty scheduled epoch in its old authority env, which
 *     is orphaned by the move. It carries no receipts and no value (bug.5079).
 *   - ADD_DERIVES_PLACEMENT (story.5039) — `present:true` DERIVES the env's placement instead of
 *     accepting it as caller input, and the route keeps `present`/`placement` MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE.
 *     There is no legitimate second answer to derive around: akash requires a `source_repo` (an
 *     external build plane), and a `source_repo`-bearing row left on k3s violates ci-cd Axiom 23
 *     (absent placement is a hard failure, not a k3s fallback). So `source_repo` present ⇒ akash +
 *     `compute_api: crossplane` (policy via `canBirthOnCrossplane`/`writerFor`) + an explicit
 *     `lease_generation` cell; no `source_repo` ⇒ k3s with no cells. The placement verb remains for
 *     LANE MIGRATION of an env already in reach, never for activation.
 *   - CONTROL_ENV_OWNS_THE_APPSET_DIR (bug.5204) — the AppSet filename carries the WORKLOAD env,
 *     its directory the CONTROL env (`controlEnvFor`): an akash node's non-production lane is
 *     reconciled by the PRODUCTION cluster. On ADD it derives from the POST-MUTATION placement —
 *     the add writes catalog + AppSet in one tree, and the pre-mutation catalog reads absent
 *     placement as k3s, i.e. the wrong directory. On REMOVE it derives from the PRE-mutation
 *     catalog — the placement cells still exist at plan time, and they name the directory the
 *     AppSet was written into.
 *   - REMOVE_COMPLETES_THE_ROW (story.5039 PR-B) — removing an env drops that env's
 *     `deployment_provider`/`compute_api`/`lease_generation` cells along with the `envs:` entry,
 *     so the emitted catalog satisfies NO_PLACEMENT_FOR_UNDECLARED_ENV
 *     (tests/ci-invariants/env-declaration-completeness.spec.ts). A stranded cell is authority
 *     pointed at a workload that does not exist — the exact shape the invariant fails CI on.
 *     For an akash lane the remove also restores the env's scheduler-worker route to the k3s
 *     in-cluster default (the byte-inverse of the add's public-host write, bug.5094), so a later
 *     re-add starts from the same bytes a never-removed row has. The CLOSE of the paid lease is
 *     deliberately NOT here: Argo prunes the AppSet → Crossplane observes REMOVE → the actuator
 *     deletes the deployment. This plan only makes the removal COMPLETE in git.
 *   - IDEMPOTENT — requesting the state that already holds (env already present on add / already absent on
 *     remove) yields an EMPTY op list (`{ kind: "no_changes" }`), so the adapter opens no PR.
 *   - DELETE_VIA_SHA_NULL — file removals are emitted as `{ op: "delete", path }`; the adapter maps these
 *     to `{ sha: null }` tree entries (delete-from-base_tree).
 *   - PLACEMENT_IS_A_LANE_SWITCH (story.5016 T5) — `buildPlacementPlan` flips WHICH lane serves an
 *     env the node already deploys to: it edits ONLY `deployment_provider.<env>` in the catalog
 *     (+ the scheduler-worker routing patch, PLACEMENT_DECIDES_THE_ADDRESS below). The overlay,
 *     external-secret, AppSet, and appsets kustomization are ALL untouched — Argo delivers BOTH the
 *     k3s Deployment AND the akash ComputeWorkload CR through the SAME per-node Application; only
 *     the overlay's CONTENT differs, and that swap happens in the materializer on the deploy
 *     branch at the next flight/promote, not in this plan. `envs:` and `compute_egress_cidrs` are
 *     untouched too — placement is a lane switch, not an undeploy (an earlier revision of this
 *     verb copied the env-removal delete ops here; that was wrong — see `buildPlacementPlan`).
 *   - PLACEMENT_DECIDES_THE_ADDRESS (bug.5094) applies to the placement lever too — the
 *     scheduler-worker's routed URL for `slug` must move with the flip (in-cluster Service DNS ⇄
 *     the node's public host), or the routing map keeps dialing the lane the node just left.
 *   - TEMPLATE_OVERLAY_IS_RENDER_SOURCE — node-template's overlay FILES are the per-env render template
 *     every wizard node clones; its DEPLOYMENT is not special. A node-template remove deletes only the
 *     appset (+ kustomization entry + catalog env) and keeps the overlay files in the tree.
 *   - OPERATOR_SELF_HOSTS_THE_VERB — the operator control plane cannot remove its own deployment from
 *     an env; fail closed (422).
 * Side-effects: none — pure string transforms.

 * WHY THIS IS A VERB AND NOT A CATALOG PR. A node with a geo-fenced outbound dependency cannot
 * satisfy its own product contract from an arbitrary jurisdiction (bug.5270: 200/200 of poly's
 * production CLOB orders were refused 403 from Belgium). Before this, the only way to express that
 * was a hand-edited monorepo catalog PR — so the node could not CHOOSE anything; an operator with
 * repo access chose for it. This makes the choice a repeatable, RBAC-gated, self-serve control
 * whose output is still the same reviewed catalog commit.
 *
 * Invariants:
 *   - REGION_REQUIRES_AKASH: only a marketplace placement screens bids, so the cell is meaningless
 *     on a k3s-placed env and would be desired state nothing enforces. Fail closed.
 *   - REGION_BINDS_ON_A_FRESH_MINT: Akash refuses in-place placement change, so a new requirement
 *     takes effect only on a new lease. The plan therefore ALWAYS moves `lease_generation` with the
 *     cell — a region edit that left the generation alone would be silently inert, which is the
 *     "a verb that succeeds and does nothing is BROKEN" failure.
 *   - GENERATION_IS_NOT_CALLER_INPUT: the generation is derived from ledger-receipt evidence by the
 *     caller (`requiredLeaseGeneration`) and passed in; this function never synthesizes one.
 *   - EGRESS_COUPLING_OR_REFUSE: the row must already declare `compute_egress_cidrs`, because a
 *     provider admitted by this requirement whose NAT is absent there boots a workload that then
 *     cannot reach the env VM's substrate ports — a mystery outage, not a config error (the
 *     bug.5191 class). Mirrors the same rule in `infra/catalog/_schema.json`.
 *   - NOT_A_GUARANTEE: the screener compares a provider's ADVERTISED/ingress country, which is not
 *     proven to equal the egress identity its workload presents to a third party. This narrows the
 *     candidate pool; only the workload's own outbound probe proves reachability.
