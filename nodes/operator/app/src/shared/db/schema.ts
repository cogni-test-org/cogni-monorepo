/**
 * Module: `@shared/db/schema`
 * Purpose: Barrel re-export of all database schema — the shared @cogni/db-schema package plus the operator-local tables.
 * Scope: Re-exports only. Does not define any tables - shared definitions live in packages/db-schema,
 *   operator-local ones in sibling files here.
 * Invariants: This file must not define any tables - only re-export from the package.
 * Side-effects: none
 * Links: docs/spec/packages-architecture.md
