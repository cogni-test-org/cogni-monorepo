/**
 * Module: `@bootstrap/jobs/resolveRoutableNodeGovernanceConfigs`
 * Purpose: Enumerate every routable node and synthesize its epoch-collect dispatch schedule, so the
 *   operator can schedule `NodeTaskWorkflow(/api/internal/attribution/collect)` INTO each node. The
 *   dispatch payload is only `{ nodeId }`; the NODE self-serves its own ledger config in
 *   `runCollectPass` (NODE_WRITES_OWN_LEDGER), so the operator does NOT read the node's repo-spec.
 * Scope: Service-role (non-RLS) DB read of locally deployed `nodes` in ('published','active') whose
 *   singleton `activity_env` equals this process's `DEPLOY_ENVIRONMENT`. NO GitHub App reads, NO deploy
 *   plane, NO monorepo git dependency — a freshly-provisioned env dispatches from its projected registry.
 * Invariants:
 *   - NODE_OWNS_ITS_LEDGER: the operator never reads a node's ledger/cron from git; it dispatches
 *     `{ nodeId }` and the node builds the collect envelope from ITS OWN repo-spec (the node's
 *     `/api/internal/attribution/collect` route — NODE_WRITES_OWN_LEDGER).
 *   - COLLECT_CADENCE_DEFAULT: the operator polls each node's collect on a fixed daily cadence
 *     (mirrors the operator's own LEDGER_INGEST cron in `.cogni/repo-spec.yaml`). `ensureEpochForWindow`
 *     is idempotent, so a poll cadence is safe regardless of the node's own epoch length.
 *   - FAIL_SOFT_PER_NODE: a node with no `activity_ledger` fail-softs (its `/collect` returns 400
 *     "ledger config not present"); a node without the receiver route 404s. The at-most-once dispatch
 *     absorbs both — no schedule creation is blocked.
 *   - NO_MONOREPO_GIT_READ: replaces the prior per-node App-read of `.cogni/repo-spec.yaml`, which
 *     404'd on any env where the operator App is not installed on the node's parent repo — the bug
 *     that produced ZERO dispatch schedules (and thus no node epochs) on candidate-a (story.5001).
 *   - LOCAL_ACTIVITY_AUTHORITY_ONLY: a row schedules only when `DEPLOY_ENVIRONMENT` is in
 *     `deploy_envs` AND equals `activity_env`. Multi-env deployment never means multi-env scheduling.
 * Side-effects: IO (service-DB read of `nodes`).
 * Links: packages/scheduler-core/src/services/syncGovernanceSchedules.ts,
 *   node-template `app/src/app/api/internal/attribution/collect/route.ts` (the receiver),
 *   docs/spec/substrate-temporal.md, .cogni/repo-spec.yaml (operator's own LEDGER_INGEST cron)
