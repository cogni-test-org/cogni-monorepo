/**
 * Module: `@bootstrap/akash-tx-actuator`
 * Purpose: The composition root task.5095 deliberately omitted — the dedicated process that
 *   binds `AkashTxActuator` over the Akash Console client, the durable allocation ledger and
 *   the serving probe, and serves the four bounded operations on a PRIVATE ClusterIP the
 *   Crossplane XComputeWorkload Composition calls (task.5102).
 * Scope: Wiring, minimal env validation and lifecycle only. Every decision about WHEN to
 *   observe/create/update/delete belongs to Crossplane, and every decision about whether a
 *   transaction is safe belongs to the actuator — neither is re-implemented here. No watches,
 *   no leader election, no reconciliation.
 *
 *   ONE exception, added deliberately by bug.5192: a bounded interval that asks the actuator
 *   to sweep stale allocation receipts. It is NOT reconciliation — it drives no desired state,
 *   observes no Kubernetes object and retries nothing. It exists because the one failure a
 *   request-scoped actuator structurally cannot handle is the request's own process dying
 *   mid-transaction, and the receipt that leaves behind holds a WALLET-WIDE slot: without a
 *   sweeper, one dead process stops every node in the environment from leasing. Crossplane
 *   cannot do this job either — it only ever calls about ONE workload, and the wedged receipt
 *   belongs to a different one.
 * Invariants:
 *   - ONE_WALLET_ONE_WRITER: the wallet identity comes from `resolveAkashTxWallet`, which
 *     REFUSES a missing `AKASH_ACTUATOR_CONSOLE_API_KEY` or a missing pinned
 *     `AKASH_ACTUATOR_ACCOUNT_ID`, and then `assertActuatorWalletAccount` proves against the
 *     LIVE Console account read that the credential opens the pinned wallet — before anything
 *     listens. A refusal exits non-zero; there is no degraded mode that spends from a wallet a
 *     second writer already owns.
 *   - LEDGER_SCOPE_IS_MIGRATED (bug.5187): the ledger scope is keyed on the pinned Console
 *     ACCOUNT, never on `DEPLOY_ENVIRONMENT`, and `wallet_scope` is half the key `claimOnce`
 *     uses to find a prior receipt. So this root also counts env-keyed rows once at boot and
 *     REFUSES to serve while any remain — a pod that beats its migrator would otherwise look
 *     straight past still-billing leases and mint a second one beside each. The reverse order
 *     is covered by the database: `akash_tx_allocations_wallet_scope_account_check` makes the
 *     legacy form unwritable, so an old pod that outlives the migration fails loudly instead.
 *   - NEVER_HOLDS_TWO_WALLETS: the legacy ComputeWorkload controller's `AKASH_CONSOLE_API_KEY`
 *     is NOT projected here and is never read. Holding it to byte-compare it (task.5095) was
 *     the opposite of isolation; separation is a revocation fact plus the pinned account
 *     assertion (story.5016).
 *   - PRIVATE_BY_CONSTRUCTION: a bearer token is required before the socket is opened. The
 *     Service is ClusterIP-only and never behind an Ingress or a public route.
 *   - SECRETS_ARRIVE_AS_FILES: credentials are read from a projected Secret volume, never from
 *     the process env, so they cannot leak into a crash dump of `process.env` or a child env.
 *     The wallet credential + bearer token come from the actuator's OWN ExternalSecret
 *     (`akash-tx-actuator-env-secrets` ← cogni/<env>/akash-tx-actuator), which the public
 *     operator app has no path to. Only the ledger DSN is projected from the operator bucket.
 *     The pinned account id is NOT a secret and correctly arrives as plain env config.
 *   - SURGE_IS_SAFE_HERE: unlike the ComputeWorkload controller, correctness does not rest on a
 *     Kubernetes Lease. Two live replicas cannot both spend, because the wallet slot is a
 *     partial unique index in Postgres (`akash_tx_allocations_single_writer_idx`) — and since
 *     bug.5187 that slot is keyed on the ACCOUNT, so it serializes the replicas of a writer
 *     that serves several environments just as it serializes two replicas serving one.
 *   - MIGRATION_RUNNER_IS_WIRED_BUT_NEVER_GATES (task.5135): the same
 *     `KubernetesMigrationJobAdapter` the ComputeWorkload controller uses is still wired here,
 *     against the SAME per-digest Job names in this namespace, so the two lanes cannot disagree
 *     about whether a bundle digest has migrated. What changed is WHERE it is consulted: the
 *     RELEASE step on `observe`, never the paid create/update. An actuator built WITHOUT it no
 *     longer refuses every paid transaction — it reports `migration.phase: "unavailable"` and
 *     still mints the lease. Renting compute must not depend on a database being reachable.
 *   - LEAST_KUBERNETES_PRIVILEGE: the ONLY Kubernetes objects this process touches are the
 *     migration Jobs it creates on the release tick and the Pods it reads to classify a Failed
 *     one. Its Role (infra/k8s/base/akash-tx-actuator/rbac.yaml) grants exactly that and
 *     nothing else — no computeworkloads, no leases, no events, no configmaps. Crossplane still
 *     owns every CR. FOLLOW-UP: with the paid path no longer touching Kubernetes at all, this
 *     runner can be lifted out of the wallet-holding process entirely (see task.5135's PR).
 * Side-effects: IO (HTTP listener; Akash Console transactions; Postgres ledger writes;
 *   Kubernetes migration Job create/read/delete in this namespace)
