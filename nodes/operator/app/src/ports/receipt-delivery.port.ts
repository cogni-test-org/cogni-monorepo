/**
 * Module: `@ports/receipt-delivery`
 * Purpose: Port for delivering normalized attribution receipts to the OWNING node's own ledger
 *   over its internal HTTP API (operator gateway → node). Implemented by the HTTP delivery adapter.
 * Scope: Interface only. Does not contain implementations or perform I/O.
 * Invariants: Named exports only, no runtime coupling. Features depend on this port, never on the adapter.
 * Side-effects: none
 * Links: adapters/server/ingestion/http-receipt-delivery.ts, /api/internal/attribution/receipts,
 *   docs/design/attribution-operator-gateway.md, task.0280
