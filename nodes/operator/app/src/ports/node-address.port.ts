/**
 * Module: `@ports/node-address`
 * Purpose: The ONE seam that answers "what base URL does this operator dial to reach node `<slug>`?".
 *   Every operator→node internal client depends on this port instead of baking an address
 *   convention into its own module.
 * Scope: Interface only. No implementations, no I/O.
 * Invariants:
 *   - PLACEMENT_DECIDES_THE_ADDRESS: the answer is a function of the node's DECLARED deployment
 *     placement, not of the caller. A node placed on decentralized compute has no in-cluster
 *     Service, so a caller that assumes `http://<slug>-node-app:3000` is simply wrong (bug.5106).
 *   - NO_NODE_NAMES_IN_CODE: implementations read declared data; a node slug never appears in a
 *     branch. Adding or moving a node is a catalog edit, never an operator code change.
 *   - ADDRESS_IS_A_BASE: callers append their own path (`/api/internal/...`). No trailing slash.
 * Side-effects: none (interface only)
 * Links: src/adapters/server/node-registry/node-address.adapter.ts,
 *   src/shared/node-registry/placement.ts, src/adapters/server/ingestion/http-receipt-delivery.ts,
 *   src/adapters/server/ingestion/http-epochs-read.ts, bug.5106, story.5016
