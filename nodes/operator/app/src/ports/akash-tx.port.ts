/**
 * Module: `@ports/akash-tx.port`
 * Purpose: The irreducible Akash transaction boundary as a typed logical contract —
 *   observe/create/update/delete plus the two seams it needs (a Console transaction client
 *   and a durable allocation ledger). This is the actuator's interface, NOT a controller:
 *   no watches, timers, finalizers, retry policy, or reconciliation live behind it (task.5095).
 * Scope: Interface + error-code definitions only. Generic reconciliation (retry, backoff,
 *   readiness gating, deletion policy, composition) belongs to Crossplane and is deliberately
 *   absent here.
 * Invariants:
 *   - KEY_IS_THE_IDEMPOTENCE_BOUNDARY: every mutation carries a caller-owned `cogniKey`;
 *     replaying a key never mints a second paid lease.
 *   - RECEIPT_BEFORE_TRANSACTION: the ledger's cursor is written before any Console POST, so a
 *     lost response is recoverable from durable evidence alone.
 *   - IDENTITY_BEFORE_TRANSACTION: every mutating call carries an explicit
 *     `AkashTxWorkloadIdentity`, and that identity is durable in the SAME receipt before the
 *     Console is contacted. Identity is never inferred from the key, the slug, or the wallet.
 *   - FAIL_CLOSED_BUT_RECOVERABLE: an allocation that cannot be resolved to exactly one LIVE
 *     lease is reported as ambiguous and never healed by a fresh create. An allocation PROVEN
 *     not to be billing is a different thing entirely: it settles itself, releases the wallet
 *     slot, and is retryable under the same key (`allocation_rolled_back`). bug.5192 is what
 *     happens when those two are the same state — fail-closed with no exit is an outage.
 *   - MIGRATION_IS_NOT_A_PAYMENT_PRECONDITION (task.5135): no mutating call carries a migration
 *     requirement, and no migration state can refuse one. Renting compute proves nothing about
 *     a database. The per-digest migration is a RELEASE step stated on `observe` — the unpaid,
 *     level-triggered tick — whose phase is REPORTED to the caller and never enforced here.
 *     What this buys: the paid path needs no database-adjacent capability at all, and a
 *     workload with a bad or missing schema fails READINESS (bounded by the composite's boot
 *     SLO) instead of silently never being created — the toks5 failure mode, where a valid XR
 *     with a valid digest never reached the actuator and never existed in any environment.
 *   - REFUSAL_IS_OBSERVABLE: every code here is a stable string safe for logs, Events and
 *     Crossplane conditions — a refusal a caller cannot see is a bug (bug.5115 shape).
 * Side-effects: none (types only)
 * Links: features/compute/akash-tx/akash-tx-actuator.ts,
 *   adapters/server/compute/akash-compute.adapter.ts, @shared/db/akash-tx-allocations,
 *   story.5016 R2.2, task.5095, task.5103
