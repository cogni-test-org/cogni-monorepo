/**
 * Module: `@ports/deploy-plane`
 * Purpose: Operator-local deploy control plane for candidate flight dispatch.
 * Scope: Interface only. Keeps hosted deploy operations out of shared AI-tool capabilities.
 * Invariants:
 *   - OPERATOR_OWNS_DEPLOY: deploy mutations target the operator parent repo/workflows.
 *   - NODE_REF_ARTIFACT_GATE: node-ref flight dispatch requires a resolvable source artifact.
 *   - ONE_PROMOTION_PRIMITIVE: every promotion rung (candidate-a, preview, production)
 *     dispatches `promote-and-deploy.yml` directly via the operator App — no rung routes
 *     through a code-branch PR. Preview AND production share ONE method (`promoteNode`),
 *     differing only by dispatched `env` + the route's authz. Both are SOURCE-ADDRESSED by the
 *     node image sha (`node_source_sha` input, like candidate-flight) for REMOTE-SOURCE (fork)
 *     nodes: the workflow resolves the image from the input and records the pin on the env deploy
 *     branch, writing ZERO commits to `main` (task.5022; the App's main-write privilege is reserved
 *     for governance/code merges). IN-REPO nodes (no catalog `source_repo`) are not source-addressed
 *     by node sha — they pass `source_sha` (the operator checkout ref) instead.
 * Side-effects: none
 * Links: docs/spec/node-ci-cd-contract.md, src/app/api/v1/vcs/flight/route.ts
