/**
 * Module: `@app/_facades/deploy/node-preview-promote.server`
 * Purpose: Node-merge → preview tie. On a spawned node-repo PR merge, promote the node to
 *   preview the same way production promotes — the operator dispatches promote-and-deploy at
 *   env=preview SOURCE-ADDRESSED by the merged node head sha (`node_source_sha`), writing ZERO
 *   commits to main. Gives node spawns the same merge→preview model in-repo nodes get, out of
 *   the box.
 * Scope: Webhook-triggered facade. Resolves the node, delegates the source-addressed dispatch
 *   to the operator deploy plane (ONE_PROMOTION_PRIMITIVE; task.5022 — no main write; the pin
 *   lands on deploy/preview).
 * Invariants:
 *   - SPAWNED_NODES_ONLY: acts only when the merged-PR repo resolves to a registered node
 *     row by slug. The parent monorepo and in-repo nodes are unregistered here, so their
 *     merges never double-process — flight-preview.yml owns them. Every registered node
 *     (including node-template, a seeded registry row since story.5009 that deploys via the
 *     monorepo catalog — task.5087 retired its external-repo carve-out) promotes preview
 *     through this hook.
 *   - MERGED_ONLY: fires on `pull_request` action=closed with `merged===true`.
 *   - PIN_IS_PR_HEAD_SHA: pins the PR head SHA — the build the node's PR CI published as
 *     `sha-<headSha>` (the SHA candidate-a already flights). The squash-merge commit on the
 *     node's main has no guaranteed image.
 *   - V0_NO_RBAC: a node cleared auth to reach candidate-a; preview-on-merge rides that grant.
 *     A `node.promote` gate is vNext if a node can earn preview without candidate-a.
 * Side-effects: IO (DB read, GitHub REST/GraphQL via DeployPlanePort). Fire-and-forget.
 * Links: docs/spec/ci-cd.md, docs/spec/node-ci-cd-contract.md,
 *   src/ports/deploy-plane.port.ts, .github/workflows/promote-and-deploy.yml
