/**
 * Module: `@app/identity/attest/confirm`
 * Purpose: The account-intent gate. Shows which GitHub account GitHub authenticated and
 *   which node is asking, and requires a deliberate click before anything is signed.
 * Scope: Renders the broker cookie's resolved state. Signs nothing.
 * Invariants:
 *   - INTENT_IS_EXPLICIT: `prompt=select_account` forces GitHub's picker but does NOT
 *     prove intent — it cannot force credential re-entry and is undocumented for the
 *     zero/one-account case. This screen is the only thing that proves the human meant
 *     THIS account for THIS node (task.5024).
 *   - NO_SILENT_ISSUANCE: no auto-submit, no redirect-on-render.
 *   - ONE_QUESTION: the screen asks "this account, this node?" and shows nothing that
 *     does not help answer it. Prose here is a bug — a human under a security prompt
 *     reads the identity and the verb, nothing else.
 * Side-effects: IO (cookie read)
 * @public
