/**
 * Module: `@app/identity/attest/confirm/actions`
 * Purpose: The three terminal actions on the account-intent gate, with a real pending
 *   state — submitting posts a full navigation, so without this the screen sits inert
 *   after the click and reads as broken.
 * Scope: Presentation + submit state only. Decides nothing; the server route owns every
 *   outcome.
 * Invariants:
 *   - NO_AUTO_SUBMIT: nothing fires without a human click. This screen is the account
 *     intent gate (task.5024); an auto-submit would defeat its entire purpose.
 *   - ONE_SUBMIT: once a choice is made all three are disabled, so a double-click cannot
 *     race two terminal actions against one consume-once broker cookie.
 * Side-effects: navigation (form POST)
 * @public
