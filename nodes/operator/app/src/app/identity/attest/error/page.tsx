/**
 * Module: `@app/identity/attest/error`
 * Purpose: Terminal failure surface for the identity broker, so every rejected leg lands
 *   on a page that says what happened instead of a blank redirect.
 * Scope: Renders a known code. Holds no state and never retries.
 * Invariants:
 *   - NO_LEAK: only a fixed, enumerated reason is shown; never token, code, or request
 *     internals. An unrecognised code falls back to the generic reason.
 *   - SHARED_CHROME: uses PageContainer/SectionCard so a failed verification looks like
 *     the product rather than a stack-trace page.
 * Side-effects: none
 * @public
 */
