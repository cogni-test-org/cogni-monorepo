/**
 * Module: `@tests/component/db/akash-tx-wallet-scope-backfill.int`
 * Purpose: Prove the bug.5187 cutover cannot double-spend. `wallet_scope` is HALF the key
 *   `claimOnce` looks a prior receipt up by — `(wallet_scope, cogni_key)` — so re-deriving it
 *   from the Console account instead of the environment hides every existing receipt unless the
 *   rows move in the same change. A hidden receipt makes the reconciler conclude "nothing was
 *   ever created" and mint a SECOND PAID LEASE beside one that is still billing.
 * Scope: Replays the committed 0048 migration against a REAL Postgres holding legacy env-keyed
 *   receipts, then asks the ledger adapter the exact question the reconciler asks. Touches no
 *   Akash Console, no wallet and no provider.
 * Invariants: RECEIPT_SURVIVES_THE_CUTOVER, NO_PREPARING_ROW_IS_REWRITTEN,
 *   ROW_COUNTS_ARE_ASSERTED, LEGACY_SCOPE_IS_UNWRITABLE_AFTERWARDS.
 * Side-effects: IO (Postgres via testcontainers; drops and re-adds the account-scope CHECK
 *   inside a transaction, so a rollback restores the schema exactly). Connects as `app_user`
 *   (DATABASE_URL) rather than the seed/service role, because only the DB OWNER may ALTER the
 *   table — and `app_user` is exactly the role the migrator itself runs as in production.
 * Links: src/adapters/server/db/migrations/0048_complex_sister_grimm.sql,
 *   src/adapters/server/compute/akash-tx-allocation-ledger.adapter.ts,
 *   src/features/compute/akash-tx/akash-tx-wallet.ts, bug.5187
