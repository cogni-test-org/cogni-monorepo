/**
 * Module: `@tests/unit/components/ConfirmActions.spec`
 * Purpose: Pin the wire contract of the identity broker's one human gate. The confirm
 *   screen was rewritten AFTER the human validation of task.5024, so the axis a human
 *   proved on candidate-a — click "Link @flock-leader" and get exactly one attestation
 *   for exactly that account — is re-proven here instead of re-run by hand on every
 *   subsequent edit.
 * Scope: The client component only. It decides nothing; `api/auth/attest/confirm` owns
 *   every outcome and reads ONLY the posted `action` value.
 * Invariants:
 *   - ACTION_VALUES_ARE_THE_CONTRACT: the server route branches on `confirm` / `switch`
 *     and treats everything else as cancelled. A `Button` that dropped `name`/`value`
 *     would silently turn every confirmation into a cancel, with no type error — so the
 *     submitted attributes are asserted on the DOM, not inferred from the component.
 *   - NO_AUTO_SUBMIT: nothing is posted without a human click (task.5024 — an
 *     auto-submit defeats the entire purpose of the gate).
 *   - ONE_SUBMIT: one click disables all three, so a double-click cannot race two
 *     terminal actions against one consume-once broker cookie.
 * Side-effects: none
 * Links: src/app/identity/attest/confirm/actions.tsx, task.5024
 * @vitest-environment jsdom
